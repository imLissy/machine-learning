I woke up at 6:30 this morning and started my day off right at the gym. I called my parents up at 8:30 and told them I was ready to go when they were. Of course I woke them up :) We had breakfast at the hotel's buffet and then went to catch an open bus tour.

After waiting over an hour, which wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't so chilly today, we finally got on a bus. It took us around most of the city and we got off at the second to last stop because I had to use the bathroom. We walked from the one end of Via del Corso to the other.

We shopped on the way back to the hotel. I bought some crazy earrings just because they were so crazy and relatively cheap :) I saw a dress that I liked, but it was pretty expensive, so I'll have to think about it before committing that kind of money.

We had dinner at a place near the hotel since it was rather late and rather chilly by the time we set out again. We wanted gelato after our meal and I tried googling to see if there was a place by and couldn't find one that was open.

We spent all day today at The Vatican. Our tour was supposed to be 1-4, it didn't actually end until around 6:45 which was pretty great minus the pain from standing/walking, hunger and thirst. Needless to say we had pretty awesome tour guide. Had we gone through everything on our own, we wouldn't know what the hell we were looking at, well, you know, besides, oh that's pretty, oh, there's Jesus, ya know.

Obviously the highlight of the tour was the Sistine Chapel. People really like to take photos, flash photos, even though the flash destroys the paintings. You're not supposed to take photos at all in there, but so many people do, apparently they've stopped trying to tell them not to.

He talked quite a bit about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1n_%28Miguel_%C3%81ngel%29.jpg"">this famous image from the ceiling</a>. Our guide there was a doctor who took a tour of the chapel and he pointed out to his guide that on the right, it looks like a brain, so it's like God transferring knowledge into Adam. He and his guide wrote a book about it together.

Most pictures I took were of St. Peter's Basilica. They don't have paintings in there, just statues and mosaics.

We spent a lot of time looking and talking about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_%28Michelangelo%29"" title=""The PietÃ ""></a>. Michelangelo was quite young when he sculpted it.

You all are funny. I write about The Vatican and the Sistine Chapel, no comments. I got five comments on the post before that, all on my earrings. FYI, yesterday was our epic tour, so you should read that entry too.

Today was our cooking class! My mom and I took a taxi there because we were afraid of getting lost. Daddy didn't want to do the class, so we left him behind.

<img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xN1dB4e97rs/TpRpdrmU_YI/AAAAAAAAAXA/AMLAVTHMHx4/s640/rome%252520001.JPG"" class=""aligncenter"" width=""640"" height=""480"" />

We made a four course meal. The first was pumpkin blossoms stuffed with mozzarella and meat or eggplant, beer battered and fried. Our pasta was spaghetti carbonara . Second course was... it was meat, cheese and bread wrapped in beef. Dessert was teramisu. 

Probably the most interesting I learned today was how to cook with raw eggs. The only danger comes from the shell, since that's the part that passes through the chicken and gets contaminated with salmonella. So to protect against contamination, you can place them in boiling water for five seconds to kill the bacteria and crack your eggs open over a separate bowl so you don't get any egg shell in your eggs. We used the raw eggs in the teramisu and the carbonara. Both of these were my favorites today :)

The carbonara was fun to make. Yes, we made the pasta fresh, from scratch, eggs from wheat fed chickens and all. It was delicious, though probably not something I'll ever do again. The sauce was awesome, so I might try making that if I can find pork cheek in the supermarket...

We also made fresh tomato sauce for the beef which I need to try again sometime because it was pretty easy.

Teramisu isn't supposed to have alcohol in it by the way. He says that chefs sometimes use alcohol to keep it from going bad, so if you're in Italy and you taste alcohol in your teramisu, it's probably old. Plus, it means ""pick me up,"" because of the coffee, so puting alcohol in it kinda has the opposite effect. And it worked. I was very sleepy before dessert and I'm wide awake now. This is what happens when you never drink coffee. Usually I don't like teramisu because of the coffee, but this was delicious.

We took the bus back from the class. I am never taking a bus in Rome again. Not unless the men suddenly start wearing deoderant. This dude had his armit directly over, touching, my head. I yell to my mom, ""hey, let's get out at the next stop!"" ""Why, don't we have a while yet?"" ""It's not that far, we can walk!"" Plus there were so many people and more were going to get on before we got to our stop, I couldn't take it anymore.

Not sure what we're doing tonight, but I see more gelato in my future. Yes, even after the four course meal. Everyone was saying how much food there was, but I don't know about that. I had seconds of everything but dessert :D",Rome Day 4,,,,,,

We also made fresh tomato sauce for the beef which I need to try again sometime because it was pretty easy.

Teramisu isn't supposed to have alcohol in it by the way. He says that chefs sometimes use alcohol to keep it from going bad, so if you're in Italy and you taste alcohol in your teramisu, it's probably old. Plus, it means ""pick me up,"" because of the coffee, so puting alcohol in it kinda has the opposite effect. And it worked. I was very sleepy before dessert and I'm wide awake now. This is what happens when you never drink coffee. Usually I don't like teramisu because of the coffee, but this was delicious.

Not sure what we're doing tonight, but I see more gelato in my future. Yes, even after the four course meal. Everyone was saying how much food there was, but I don't know about that. I had seconds of everything but dessert :D",Rome Day 4,,,,,,

We spent all day today at The Vatican. Our tour was supposed to be 1-4, it didn't actually end until around 6:45 which was pretty great minus the pain from standing/walking, hunger and thirst. Needless to say we had pretty awesome tour guide. Had we gone through everything on our own, we wouldn't know what the hell we were looking at, well, you know, besides, oh that's pretty, oh, there's Jesus, ya know. 

<img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JSKh5a7uPTg/TpNNSMPX9dI/AAAAAAAAAVA/2Tas0fFwReA/s640/rome%252520007.JPG"" class=""alignnone"" width=""640"" height=""480"" />

Obviously the highlight of the tour was the Sistine Chapel. People really like to take photos, flash photos, even though the flash destroys the paintings. You're not supposed to take photos at all in there, but so many people do, apparently they've stopped trying to tell them not to.

He talked quite a bit about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Creaci%C3%B3n_de_Ad%C3%A1n_%28Miguel_%C3%81ngel%29.jpg"">this famous image from the ceiling</a>. Our guide there was a doctor who took a tour of the chapel and he pointed out to his guide that on the right, it looks like a brain, so it's like God transferring knowledge into Adam. He and his guide wrote a book about it together.

Most pictures I took were of St. Peter's Basilica. They don't have paintings in there, just statues and mosaics.

We spent a lot of time looking and talking about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet%C3%A0_%28Michelangelo%29"" title=""The PietÃ ""></a>. Michelangelo was quite young when he sculpted it. Our guide said Michelangelo had heard people talking saying someone else had sculpted it, so it went back late at night and put his name on it.

Lunch and dinner were both very tasty. Of course we also had some gelato as well :)",Rome Day 3,,,,,,

My mommy was sick this morning, so my daddy and I went on the Roman Forum/Palatine Hill/Colosseum tour without her which was a little ironic considering she's the one that wanted to do the tours in the first place.

The tour wasn't as good at the Vatican tour, but that set a pretty damn high standard. Still entertaining and informative.

The Forum tour made me think of the musical we did junior year: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Actual Forum, not as funny.

We walked to the top of Palatine Hill which was probably the best part of the tour. Our tour guide said it was kinda like Beverly Hills in that it's where the wealthy people built their palaces. For entertainment, this dude had a mini Colosseum to view from his living room.

Our guide also said the Romulus and Remus story is in the Italian text books as the explanation of how Rome was founded. Of course we're taught a lot of BS in history class too.

The view from the hill was the best part.

Then we went over to the Colloseum. It was nice not having to wait in the rather long line. Not really worth a line. It's pretty cool, but there isn't a whole lot to see there. It is only one building after all... or 1/3 of a building anyway.

The stairs were pretty crazy and we only went up to the second level. Way back when the woman were only allowed on the top level with the slaves. They must have been super fit. We also learned where the word vomit comes from. You should look at the Wikipedia entry if you're interested.

After the tour we went back to the hotel and picked mommy up for lunch. We ate at an eh place by the hotel. Then it was off to the Pantheon which I found perfectly thank you very much. My mom and I listened to Rick Steve's tour on my phone.

We had dinner at Cul de Sac. It was mentioned on at least three different lists of top notch restaurants in Rome that I've come across. I'd say it lived up to its reputation. They have 1000 different bottles of wine there, so of course I tried a glass. A much smaller glass than last night, thank God, and I got white this time. I actually liked last night's wine better. I couldn't tell you what either one was though. And I got an A in Wine Insights, tisk tisk.

We ordered assorted cheeses for an appetizer and my mom and I shared stuffed grape leaves, or vine leaves as they were called, and stuffed vegetables. The vine leaves were absolutely delicious. Much better than anything I've had in the Greek restaurants back home. The veggies and cheese were also very yummy.

Of course we stopped for gelato after dinner.

It didn't rain much on the way there, didn't rain on the way back, but boy did it pour while we were there. We got wet. We got very wet. I think I was too cold and miserable to really enjoy myself. The trip was worth it for the company though :)

The train ride was nice. Only took an hour and I got some hot tea to warm me up. Charged my cell too. Watched the pretty sunset. When we got back to Rome, it was about 10 degrees warmer and there wasn't a drop of water on the ground.

My mom and I went shopping yesterday morning by the Spanish Steps. We didn't realize we had to walk down the Spanish Steps to get to the shopping. I had to find a detour around the steps for the way back since my mom couldn't deal without a railing. My parents have been impressed by my sense of direction. Mostly I just have a good memory.

I found assume shoes I absolutely loved. Unfortunately I couldn't walk in them. If they weren't so expensive I would have bought them anyway, but 150 euros is a lot for shoes you can't walk in.

We went past a McDonald's on our way to lunch and I had to go inside because it was the freakin' fanciest McDonald's I've ever seen. I took a picture, but it's on my phone, so you might see it on Facebook in the near future if it isn't up there already. I left my memory card in my laptop. 

My mom bought a leather jacket, very expensive, but it's very nice. I saw a jacket I liked there for 980, my mom told me I should try it on. ""Why not?"" she said. I didn't try it on.

Melanie came and picked us up and drove the 3 hours (w/ traffic) to her house. Her and her husband, Sean, live outside of Naples. We had dinner together at a restaurant near their place. Delicious mozzarella. My mom and I shared an eggplant pizza. The dough was delicious. Reminded me of Naan.

Their dogs are very sweet. Miles greeted me this morning by making himself comfy on my lap. They have a very nice house. Big.They have a terrace on top with a pretty awesome view. I slept on their couch, I don't think I ever slept so well on a couch before. Though, I woke up at 7:30 when my alarm went off and I was fine. I went back to sleep, I don't know, for maybe an hour, and when I woke up again my neck hurt. I think it actually feels worse now. I don't know what happened in that hour, but it wasn't good.

We started off the day at the National Museum. That was pretty much a big yawn, but my mommy likes museums. We made a deal that if we went to the museum, she would go see the Capuchin Crypt with us. 

<img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Jx0_556bzaE/TpwolmNwqnI/AAAAAAAAAgk/gtyZXeTCrqE/s640/rome%252520005.JPG"" class=""aligncenter"" width=""640"" height=""480"" />

Can you spot the hidden Mickey? Obviously they're not supposed to be hidden Mickeys, but this gives you a glimpse into the way my brain works.

After the museum, we went back to the train station to get some chocolate. They have a Perugina store there and Bryan really likes that brand. When we left, there were many more people protesting. There were people with big communist banner and other people with drops of water painted on their face. My mom asked the water people what they were protesting. They said they didn't want the government controlling the water. Obviously they weren't with the communists. This was all way before any cars were set on fire. Not sure where that happened.

We stopped at another store on the way back to the hotel and got some souvenirs for peoples. I saw a pair of earrings I liked, but they were pretty expensive, and I didn't think I liked them that much. I went back later and bought them for the sake of buying <em>something </em>for myself. I really wanted to bring back some clothes, but they were all so expensive. The stuff I really liked were around 300 euros. I tried on a few dresses and a shirt but they didn't look right on me at all. I think women in Rome are skinnier and taller than I am. The XS was really extra small. 

I noticed there were a lot of owls. Besides those earrings I bought, I saw them on clothes all over the place. Anyone know what's up with the owls?

After dropping stuff off at the hotel, we headed to the Capuchin Crypt. Artistically arranged bones. They're supper against pictures in there, hence no photos to show. We shared some eh, quality pizza after and then, more shopping.

Dinner was interesting. I made reservations at this place that I thought was Il Quadrifoglio. When we got there, there was no Il Quadrifoglio, it was a different restaurant and apparently I had reservations there, so we ate there anyway.

<img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-U94llxCljms/TpwonXslOGI/AAAAAAAAAhA/obgZHMF6ZyY/s512/rome%252520013.JPG"" class=""aligncenter"" width=""384"" height=""512"" />

Turns out the food was delicious :) My mom and I shared two seafood pastas and this salad with avocado, peach, oranges, greens, and actual salad dressing. First time on the trip we were served dressing. It was very yummy. Oh and dessert. Our waiter told my mom she had to try the chef's dessert. ""The best tiramisu of your life!"" What we made at the cooking class was better, but it was still pretty good. I really enjoyed my panna cotta. 

We woke up at 5:30 Sunday morning. My dad called the shuttle company the day before and they said they would be at the hotel at 7. We went downstairs at 6:30, because we're always early. 7 rolled around and no shuttle. The guy at the front desk called them for us and they said they would come at 7:15. 7:15, still no shuttle. He finally showed around 7:20. We got to the airport around 8:15 and he dropped us off at a terminal that didn't say Continental with no other instructions on how to find Continental. Our flight was for 9:50. We were a little pissed.

We found out we had to take a shuttle to the other terminal where Continental was. We checked in our bags, went through security and then took another shuttle to our gate. It was 9:15 by the time we got there, our flight was supposed to start boarding at 9:05. We looked out the window and there wasn't a plane by our gate, there was a bus. They bussed us to our plane. 

<img alt="""" src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-PcDHOUEUWec/TpwopTrJq7I/AAAAAAAAAhk/lEPCmP18f5k/s640/rome%252520022.JPG"" class=""aligncenter"" width=""640"" height=""480"" />

I actually slept a lot. I couldn't keep my eyes open. When I woke up, there was still five hours left of the flight. They served us two meals. The second came with potato chips. I don't like potato chips, but I ate them because I was hungry. This turned out to be a mistake. An hour later, we had a pretty rough landing, that combined with the dehydration and the potato chips caused me to use the barf bag. At least it didn't happen until the very end of our vacation.

Buffy was a little under enthused to see us. She was like, oh hai guys, what's up? But whatever. She was pretty upset when we left to have dinner though.

By the time I got back to my house, I was sooooo tired. Hugged Bryan for a while and we chatted about what we did over the last week. I went upstairs to put on something warmer and I ended up climbing in bed and falling asleep. That was around 8:30. I woke up this morning at 6 :D I was glad I was able to sleep that late. That's pretty good for me.

I said I'd take a half day today, so I'll go into work this afternoon and sort though my hundreds of emails. Sooooo not looking forward to that. At least I get to see my friends :)

Overall, A+ trip. I'd go back again, but I'd prefer to check out another city in Europe. Probably Paris. You know, where I can go and shop for hours and hours and also not buy anything.

We went food shopping last night for our part, our HALLOWEEN party, and the power was out at ShopRite. Power has been going out all over the place because of the especially heavy snow and down trees. Yay for having power lines underground by our house :) They said it was out for three hours so we couldn't buy refrigerated stuff. Pathmark was the next closest supermarket, so we headed there to pick up the rest of our stuff.

Overall, I wish I was back there. Work sucked this week and I was just as busy after work. Wednesday I went all the way to Trenton to tell HS students how awesome my job is and try to convince them that it's not that hard. No one ever says, that sounds boring, nope, it's always, that sounds hard. I'm pretty sure my job is easier than the majority of jobs out there. 

Today was nice, got to go shopping with Bryan, oh right, when work called. They said Abhay's looking into whatever issue they had. I'd login and check, if I could ever login to my work PC. 

I have a Halloween costume. I'm pretty excited about it. It's work appropriate, I get to go crazy with eye makeup, I get to wear a crazy hat, it was only $30 and I can reuse a part of the costume another year.

I have a minor obsession with the new show, Revenge. Have you all seen it? If not, you should. It's really good. Surprisngly good. I love the characters.

I am going to get paid at least some overtime because we have to take at least once class and travel over the weekend, yay. Unless...

I get promoted first. It's unlikely, but there's an open position as one of the managers was just promoted, to be our new manager actually.

Makes me wonder how many things that just disappeared were accidentally thrown out.

I'm fine in the shower, but I get nervous in front of people :-/ Why I much prefer singing in public rather than speaking.","Yay, We Have a Manager",,,,,,
11/20/2011 20:24,11/21/2011 1:24,"Me: Have you seen the 1/2 cup measuring cup?
Bryan: No, I never use it.
Me: Are you sure you haven't seen it?
Bryan: I've never used it before.
Me: Well that doesn't mean you've never SEEN it
Bryan: I haven't seen it. If I put it somewhere, it would be in the drawer
Me: I have no idea where it is, I looked everywhere. 
Bryan: You use it a lot?
Me: Almost every day. I used it Friday. The only thing I could think is that I accidentally put it in the oatmeal container when I threw it out.
Bryan looks through the garbage, and sure enough, that's where it was, inside the oatmeal container.
Me: At least I was right.

Makes me wonder how many things that just disappeared were accidentally thrown out.

I also found my boots for CP12 training that I hadn't seen in 3 years. I remembered that last time I saw them they were inside a box in my old suitcase, in my parents' basement. Must have been my old one since I didn't get my new one until right before our wedding. And that's exactly where they were. I might put things in strange places (really, my closet would have made much more sense) but at least I find them ... assuming the garbage man hasn't gotten to them first. I also found my Corporate American Express Card. And that thing's tiny. It was behind the couch in my important documents portfolio. I knew where the AC cover was too.

Unfortunately I don't know what happened to my passport :-/ I know exactly where my old one is. I know I took it out of my purse after Rome because I didn't want to lose it and it was on the coffee table for a while... but why wouldn't I put it in the drawer under the TV then? *checks again* ... yeah, it's there.",I Always Know Exactly Where Everything Is,,,,,,
12/5/2011 10:47,12/5/2011 15:47,"We had rehearsal every night last week. What they call ""tech week."" We called it ""hell week"" in high school. We had to be there at 6:30 every night, I don't know why since we didn't start rehearsing until well after 8. Luckily the show's short, so we made it out of there at a decent time.

Opening night was Friday and it was pretty awesome. Bryan's mom even won the 50-50 raffle. They had food after too :) I asked Bryan if he wanted any, he says no. Then I tell him I already paid for it and suddenly he's starving. 

The worst part of the show has been having to wear makeup every night. I guess I don't really have to wear that much since the theater's small, but once I put on a little, I might as well go all out. I did have a reaction to something I wore yesterday. My face is all itchy today. I was wearing it longer yesterday than I have been, since the show was in the afternoon, not at night like the others. I feel like it may be the makeup remover though.

People were asking me if I'm going to audition for the next show. Unfortunately I can't because of the stupid strike duty crap. Odds are they won't strike, but I can't very well disappear for 6 weeks if they do. That wouldn't be right. And then I have another assignment for the end of the summer, then Carolyn's wedding and then Rachi's. I'm going to be a busy girl next year.

Next week is our <del datetime=""2011-12-05T15:36:44+00:00"">Holiday Extravaganza</del> End of the Year Recognition Event at work.  Trying to balance delegating and making it appear as if I'm still in charge. Either way, it's going to be pretty awesome. My biggest challenge will be trying not to eat everything in sight. 

Speaking of which, we had a little holiday party after the show yesterday. I ate very little before the show, so I was starving by the time I got home and proceeded to stuff my face. Besides feeling sick to my stomach, and my head cold that developed Saturday afternoon, it was a good time. ",Babes in Toyland,,,,,,
11/25/2011 13:00,11/25/2011 18:00,"Black Friday is pretty much the best day of work. Skipping around the hallways, no calls, no emails, no Q's. I think it may be just me, Maryam and her daughter here today. I'm the boss today too. :D That means I get to tell Maryam what to do ... more or less.

Why aren't I working from home? Well, if I did get a defect to work on, it would be impossible to do it at home. RAD over VPN is super laggy. But I woke up early today, got here early, so I will leave early.

Tonight we celebrate one year 'till Rachi and Chris' wedding! Wheeeeee! 

Thanksgiving was pretty crazy. We were supposed to have Thanksgiving #1 at Bryan's parents' last week, because his brother got a job with Apple and he's moving to CA. Well, turns out that he moved today, so they moved Thanksgiving to real Thanksgiving, but only after I invited my family to our house for Thanksgiving. So Bryan went to his mom's to say goodbye to his brother and I hosted my family at our house. Everyone but my aunt and uncle were late, but once we got all the food heated and put out the right number of plates and stuff, things went pretty smoothly. 

Except the dogs. Buffy, as you know, has developed a dog phobia. Cruiser is one of the sweetest dogs you'll ever meet, but Buffy didn't care. He is a dog and therefor something to be feared. He tried to make friends and Buffy growled at him. He was so upset. Buffy spent most of the evening trying to avoid him while still looking cool and being where the food was.

Everything was delicious. I made veggies, salad and pumpkin ice cream :) MB and Tom brought two enormous cakes and a pie. I had a little bit of both cakes. There is much cake leftover that we plan to bring to friendsgiving on Saturday. I also want to make something else so we're not just bringing unhealthy leftovers.

Got some great loot this year. <3 My new bluray player. Mostly I wanted something for the exercise room that I could play my exercise DVDs on and watch netflix when I'm on the elliptical. Works great! Gettin' my geek on with some X-Files and Doctor Who.

And I finally have nice warm winter gloves, that I can use my touch phone with :) And workout gloves so I don't get blisters when I'm liftin' the big boy weights at the gym. Disney book, warm and cosy things, chocolates :)

My cousins got us some beautiful ornaments. I'll take pictures when I put them up next year. I'm in the process of taking everything down, don't want to be adding to the crazy. 

Also gave out some great stuff this year. I think everyone liked my recipe book. I forget which one of you gave me that idea, but it was awesome. Took forever to make, but it came out nice. Yay <a href=""http://www.snapfish.com/snapfish/home"">Snapfish</a>. My dad liked his Tesla action figure and his tickets to see The Adams Family on Broadway. Just in time too, the show closes at the end of the year. Taking suggestions for places to eat in the city if you know any must tries. Buffy got a new collar that she seems absolutely indifferent too, but she really needed a new one.

Wednesday we're going bridesmaid dress shopping which I'm way more excited about than what would be considered normal. Probably because I get to hang out with the whole gang which almost never happens anymore. ",Christmas,,,,,,

12/26/2011 16:22,12/26/2011 21:22,"What an awesome Christmas. Nice having everyone here rather than choosing between my family or his :) Also fun cooking stuffs! Not so much fun cleaning stuffs, but I'm mostly done now. Washing all the bedding upstairs because my allergies have been horrible. Hope this helps :(

<a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/christmas.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/christmas.jpg"" alt="""" title=""christmas"" width=""375"" height=""500"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3543"" /></a>

Got some great loot this year. <3 My new bluray player. Mostly I wanted something for the exercise room that I could play my exercise DVDs on and watch netflix when I'm on the elliptical. Works great! Gettin' my geek on with some X-Files and Doctor Who.

And I finally have nice warm winter gloves, that I can use my touch phone with :) And workout gloves so I don't get blisters when I'm liftin' the big boy weights at the gym. Disney book, warm and cosy things, chocolates :)

My cousins got us some beautiful ornaments. I'll take pictures when I put them up next year. I'm in the process of taking everything down, don't want to be adding to the crazy. 

Also gave out some great stuff this year. I think everyone liked my recipe book. I forget which one of you gave me that idea, but it was awesome. Took forever to make, but it came out nice. Yay <a href=""http://www.snapfish.com/snapfish/home"">Snapfish</a>. My dad liked his Tesla action figure and his tickets to see The Adams Family on Broadway. Just in time too, the show closes at the end of the year. Taking suggestions for places to eat in the city if you know any must tries. Buffy got a new collar that she seems absolutely indifferent too, but she really needed a new one.

Wednesday we're going bridesmaid dress shopping which I'm way more excited about than what would be considered normal. Probably because I get to hang out with the whole gang which almost never happens anymore. ",Christmas,,,,,,
1/17/2012 17:36,1/17/2012 22:36,"I'd say I did a pretty good job planning this trip. The longest line we waited on was for Harry Potter at Universal, our meals were all pretty good and we didn't really feel rushed or bored. Couldn't ask for much better weather in January either. Hit 80 one day. So nice.

We ate at Raglan Road Saturday night. It's an Irish restaurant in Downtown Disney. After my mom went back and forth with the waitress about 300 times over what items on the menu didn't have alcohol, we finally got some pretty tastey food. After, Bryan and I went to our favorite store there where our favorite artist likes to hang out. He was there. He didn't remember Bryan but he remembered me, ha! 

Sunday was marathon day. I heard the buses would be running behind because they have to reroute traffic, but we made it to the Animal Kingdom fairly quickly. Actually, we didn't have to wait for a bus all day. Nor for any rides. The park was pretty empty. We finished so early, we didn't know what to do. No characters we didn't get pictures with already either. We had lunch at Yak and Yeti. Dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Our bus driver missed the exit and had to turn around. Then, at the first stop, we didn't know what the stop was. We asked him if this is where the restaurant was and he didn't know. He said yes, we got off, then he honed and waved us back. No, it's the other stop.

We went to the Magic Kingdom after dinner and did a bunch of the classics. Usually Jungle Cruise has a long wait, so I haven't been on it in years. No wait and the guide was hilarious. The Tiki Room is back to it's classic self and no longer ""under new management."" The Haunted  Mansion also has a new interactive queue. 

Monday, we transferred over to the boardwalk which was a little bit more of a headache than I expected it to be, mostly because Bryan's suitcase broke. They transferred mine for me, but Bryan didn't want them to lose his. That and I made my parents stay in their room so we could leave our stuff in there, but they actually had our room ready. We made it, our luggage and all. I got my lunch from Morocco CS and Bryan got sushi from Japan. We mostly hung around world showcase 'cause the future world rides are gettin' a little old. We did see Captain EO again :)

We had dinner at the restaurant formerly known as Spoodles, AKA: Kouzina. We had reservations but waited over half an hour for a table. The manager gave us free appetizers, but then they wouldn't give us our vacation club discount because we didn't have our membership card with us. Every other restaurant accepted our Key to the World card no problem. The food was pretty good, but not amazing. We'll probably skip it next trip.

Tueday we went to Hollywood Studios. No Fantasmic this week, so don't have to worry about crowded Fantasmic days. We were able to get fastpasses for Toy Story really easy and pretty much everything else was walk-on. The new Star Tours is awesome! I was watching the Disney ""Must Do"" channel while I was working out and learned that there are like 50 combinations of scenes you can get, so we went back there on Thursday morning and rode it two more times :D The second time we had almost the exact same ride as the first time, the second was our best tour though :D

We ate lunch at Sci-Fi Tuesday afternoon and had mediocre veggie burgers. The ones we had at Liberty Tree Wednesday were much better. Delicious in fact. One of my favorite meals of the trip. The desserts and ambiance at Sci-Fi are always worth the trip though. Oh, and a little tip, alcohol makes Toy Story Midway Mania extra fun. 

Dinner was on the Boardwalk again, this time at the Flying Fish. My mom and I shared the Mahi Mahi and Scallops. Both were super yummy. That plus the appetizers filled us up too much for dessert. We brought back treats from the bakery instead. 

Wednesday it was back to the Magic Kingdom for those yummy veggie burgers (+sweet potato fries). I think Space Mountain and Splash Mountain get better every year. We should have done Thunder Mountain on Sunday 'cause it was closed. We got our picture with Prince Eric and Ariel, barely. They spent over ten minutes with the same two kids. The girl was like bringing them flowers and stuff. Still love the Laugh Floor. Got to see some of the new Fantasy Land construction. Piglet is still MIA.

We had dinner at the California Grill. As last time, amazing, expensive food. Got to see the fireworks from their observation deck. They didn't have my smores dessert I saw on the online menu though, so that was disappointing. Dessert Friday made up for that, but I'll get to that later. Getting back from the Cali Grill was an experience. When I made the reservation, I thought the Magic Kingdom closed at 9. It had closed early all week at 8. So, we couldn't take a bus back to our hotel from there. We had to go all the way to Downtown Disney and that bus took a whopping 40 minutes to show up.

Thursday we went to Hollywood Studios in the morning and then back to EPCOT. We ate lunch at France on a whim and it turns out my parents had a similar whim as we ran into them there. My dad's cousin also met up with us there. Again, we mostly did the countries. We finally caught up with Brer Fox in America. Bryan and I did Spaceship Earth right before dinner to make funny faces and send ourselves the postcard. We had dinner at the new restaurant in the Mexican Pavilion, La Hacienda de San Angel. It was pretty good, but forgettable. The Margaritas were interesting though.

Friday, we did something we've never done before and left Disney property. OK, we've been to Universal before, but not together. I've only been to Islands of Adventure once, Bryan's never been, and neither one of us has seen the new Harry Potter area, which is awesome btw. The Forbidden Journey ride is not what I expected it to be. After going on the Mummy and MIB, I was a little disappointed and pretty queasy too. Even Bryan felt a little sick after. It was like the goal of the ride was to make you nauseous. We would have loved to spend more time in the gift shops, but they were so incredibly small and crowded. The entire population of the park was in that section. It was pretty crazy.

We decided to have a nice sit-down meal to recover after Forbidden Journey. We went to Mythos which has been named the best theme park restaurant 6 years running. It was pretty damn good. Especially the dessert. Oh golly. Ooey, gooey, chocolate banana cake with caramel and peanut butter ice cream. OMG.

We spent a lot of time in the Dr Sues area. Super cute. Especially the baby on the Cat in the Hat ride wearing the Cat in the Hat hat. That was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen. We bought the hat for Natalie (Bryan's friend Brian's daughter). We also really liked the Hulk coaster which I rode several times last time I was there and now remember why. A bit chilly today, so we skipped Jurassic Park :( 

We had some small snacks before we left, but mostly we ate ice cream for dinner. We met up with Katie and Rachael again at Beaches :D

Saturday, we had breakfast at Kouzina. I had the French Toast Baklava, which was really more of a dessert than a breakfast, but so good. After breakfast, Bryan wanted to look for Piglet at the Magic Kingdom. The place was packed. Space Mountain had a 110 minute wait and the first time I've seen the People Mover with a line in like 15 years. Splash Mountain didn't have a line though. It was a little chilly. We went on that, didn't get wet. We got fastpasses for Space Mountain and did the laugh floor again. Never did get our picture with Piglet and he's been haunting my dreams.

Dinner was at Ohana where I stuffed myself silly. We went over there early because it was cold and lines were long. At least we figured Bryan could watch football at the bar. I got a sangria which had an awful lot of alcohol for a Disney sangria. I got lost looking for my parents. Dinner was very good though. I really liked the steak and I'm not a big steak person. The dessert was a little too good as well. I told Bryan we had to go to EPCOT and walk back to our hotel so I could use up some of the calories I consumed. It was nice to walk through EPCOT one last time. 

Sunday morning we had breakfast at Kouzina again before departing for the airport. I ordered the same thing :P It was so good! Flight back was just as pleasant as the flight there. Wish I could always fly Jetblue. Cheaper flight, free checked bags, we actually left Newark early, more legroom, they give you the whole can/bottle of your drink, your choice of snacks, free TV <-- why are they so awesome??? I watched some lifetime movie on the way back. Better than doing nothing.

Speaking of awesome, Bryan's parents picked us up from the airport and we went out for some Mexican for dinner. Good times.

Now vacation is over and I didn't miss work at all and it's really, really cold and I want to go back to Disney where it's warm and happy.",Disney 2012,,,,,,

",A Look Back at 2011,,,,,,
12/31/2011 17:12,12/31/2011 22:12,"Every year before the new year begins, I look back at past recorded years. Earlier entries have been edited for length. Current yearâs at the bottom if you want to skip to that.
<!--more-->
1996-1997:
Happy new yearâs eve. Iâm going to Jenâs house. We are eating at the Crab Shack. I was off from school.
My new yearâs resolution is to try to take a shower every day!
I was off from school, but Iâm going back tomorrow.

1997-1998:
HAPPY NEW YEAR! On nick and the Big Ball!! Letâs take a look at last yearâs New Year:
Last yearâs resolution was to take a shower every day! I did that starting in September. This year I have a few resolutions:
#1: eat less candy. #2: Wear my hair in pigtails. #3: Get straight Aâs on my report card. #4: Go to bed at the time I should. #5: Keep my room clean. Itâs a lot, but I can do it. Well the straight As thing, only counts for mp III and IIII. Stay on the Principalâs list. thatâs easier. see ya next year! I can play âAuld Land Syneâ on my keyboard. Goodbye 1997! Hello 98!! Happy New Year!!

1998-1999:
Well, itâs that time of the year again, New Years eve. Itâs been since 8 minutes ago.

Well Iâll try. I donât think this journal will reach the year 2000. By the rate Iâm going, it will. Iâm mostly writing about my dreams in my other journal. I know Elissa is reading this in 2000. Well good luck in high school. Bye for now!
Well, itâs still New Yearâs Eve. Less than an hour now. Itâs the last year theyâll drop the alynum [I was great at spelling] ball. I was serving food to the homeless before. Itâs supposed to snow. I hope it does. It will. Itâs definitely cold enough, there were some flurries before. See ya in 99!!

1999-2000:
Weâre gonna party like itâs 1999? Wait, it is! New Years Eve 1999!! A new milenium, well, sorta. Weâre going to a party @ Jenâs house. Letâs take a look at last yearâs resolutions: Actually study : ( ; Write in journal at least every week : ( ; Go to Disney World? : ( April though : ) ; Work harder- my club, school, everything : ( ; Play with the dog more : ) ; Remember to feed her : ( ; Remember : ( ;

Blinkâs gonna play! See Ya next Millium!!

2000-2001:
Happy New Years Eve 2000. Soon it will be the real Millennium. This is the last day of The millennium, the century and of 2000. 2000 went very fast. This year we went to Disney World, joined the Disney Vacation Club, went on a Disney Cruise. Cory got married, daddy got a new car, and we got a new dog too! Her name is Buffy. I ran outta room in my old journal, so I started a new one.
Big shows of 2000: Survivor- Richard won; Big flops of 2000: Big Brother- Eddie won.
Last Years Resolutions: Remember â better : ) ; Donât get a D in Geometry- : ) ; Open my time capsule!- : ) well that was easy; Keep in touch with Akua (she?s moving)- : ) ; Win a game- : ) , Mario Party and Jack

You click on more and Iâll see ya tomorrow After I get home from schoolâ¦ ickâ¦
Erclov! Happy New Years Eve again!
He, he, guess what, I have a new journal at www.loveandhonor.com/blog
Der, letâs seeâ¦ this yearâ¦ on Big Brother II- the evil doctor, Will won. And Mike poposed to Krista, it was great. Tina won on Survivor II, that was lame. I just saw Lord of the Rings. Harry Potter was the movie of the year, lolâ¦
Resolutions, I did study and I did bring up my grades, kept my pages up, got my permit, took Latin and I got on the Principalâs list. Way cool. This year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license! OKâ¦ almost 12 nowâ¦ talk to ya in 2002â¦ ooh neat, itâs the same forward and backward.
K, itâs 2002 now!! Itâs been a very interesting night. My parents were late for the party, yeah, I was here before them. And Rachel beat me at Mario Party (though I beat her later on Now sheâs serving me (pretend) ice cream and Ethan just gave me a plastic egg, make that two, lol.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!
The next day:
Well, Happy New Year everyone! Mesa had lotsa fun at party last nightâ¦ âTwas me, Kristin, Cara, and Rachelle. We watched video from the Halloween party and Andrew running into the poleâ¦ twice, lmao, then Austin Powers in Goldmember, Jeckyll and Hyde, Back to the Future!! and begining of The Others. We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me <3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan <3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod <3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae's birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke. 
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I've read is <em>the</em> IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. I'm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. I've been trying to rest it while at my parents' these last few days. I really hope it's better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolyn's wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good. 
Going to Yori's party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but I'm sure I'll come up with something yummy.",New Year's Past,,,,,,

This year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license! OKâ¦ almost 12 nowâ¦ talk to ya in 2002â¦ ooh neat, itâs the same forward and backward.
K, itâs 2002 now!! Itâs been a very interesting night. My parents were late for the party, yeah, I was here before them. And Rachel beat me at Mario Party (though I beat her later on Now sheâs serving me (pretend) ice cream and Ethan just gave me a plastic egg, make that two, lol.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me <3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan <3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod <3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae's birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke. 
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I've read is <em>the</em> IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. I'm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. I've been trying to rest it while at my parents' these last few days. I really hope it's better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolyn's wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good. 
Going to Yori's party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but I'm sure I'll come up with something yummy.",New Year's Past,,,,,,

",A Look Back at 2011,,,,,,
1/6/2012 21:18,1/7/2012 2:18,"In 1990, I went on my first trip to Disney World. I was five years old, I didn't know what Disney World was, but my parents made it sound super awesome. We stayed at the Grand Floridian. About the only thing I remember from that first trip was meeting Mary Poppins, I just about died. I believe that's also when Goofy or Pluto stepped on my foot. I don't remember that happening though.

Our second trip was in '91. We stayed at the Polynesian, it was Halloween and I was very sick.

Trips three and four were at the Caribbean. I really liked their triple-decker peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. 

We stayed at the Grand Floridian again and and then the Wilderness Lodge.

<a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/blog/?p=1933"">'96</a> We stayed at the Boardwalk for the first time, but without my mom because she had to work. 

In <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/blog/?p=1940"">'97</a> we stayed offsite. This was a mistake we would never repeat again. Splendid China doesn't do it for me.

Trip #9 we stayed at the Boardwalk villas and somehow convinced my mom to buy into DVC after our trip. 

We went on a <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/blog/?p=1959"">Disney Cruise in 2000</a> (This isn't included in the trip count) and after struggling when I returned to my classes, I kindly requested to never miss school for vacation again.

The next 6 trips, we stayed at the Boardwalk. Rachelle came with us on trips, 10, 11, 12 and 12. My dad missed 11 due to work and Carolyn came on 13.

Bryan proposed on trip 14 in 2008, and we went on our Honeymoon in 2010. Trip 16 was also in 2010, but we stayed at Saratoga since the Boardwalk was booked.

This trip we're staying two days at Saratoga and the rest at the Boardwalk. People ask me if I get tired of Disney. Going there today is a completely different experience than 20 years ago. The parks are different, I'm different, the people I'm going with are different. Last time The Festival of the Masters was my favorite thing we saw. 10 year ago that would have bored me to death. I'm a munch more adventurous eater and more into fitness than I was when I was younger. Going with Rachelle, we had fun talking along with the trolls on the Norway ride. With Bryan, we have fun hunting down characters. Every trip brings new experiences :D Can't wait!",Number 17,,,,,,

1/8/2012 22:14,1/9/2012 3:14,"So far I planned our first two days perfectly.

We ate at Raglan Road Saturday night. It's an Irish restaurant in Downtown Disney. After my mom went back and forth with the waitress about 300 times over what items on the menu didn't have alcohol, we finally got some pretty tastey food. After, Bryan and I went to our favorite store there where our favorite artist likes to hang out. He was there. He didn't remember Bryan but he remembered me, ha! 

Sunday was marathon day. I heard the buses would be running behind because they have to reroute traffic, but we made it to the Animal Kingdom fairly quickly. Actually, we didn't have to wait for a bus all day. Nor for any rides. The park was pretty empty. We finished so early, we didn't know what to do. No characters we didn't get pictures with already either. We had lunch at Yak and Yeti. Dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Our bus driver missed the exit and had to turn around. Then, at the first stop, we didn't know what the stop was. We asked him if this is where the restaurant was and he didn't know. He said yes, we got off, then he honed and waved us back. No, it's the other stop. We went to the Magic Kingdom after dinner and did a bunch of the classics. Usually Jungle Cruise has a long wait, so I haven't been on it in years. No wait and the guide was hilarious. The Tiki Room is back to it's classic self and no longer ""under new management."" The Haunted  Mansion also has a new interactive queue. ",I'm Good at This,,,,,,

Then, at the first stop, we didn't know what the stop was. We asked him if this is where the restaurant was and he didn't know. He said yes, we got off, then he honed and waved us back. No, it's the other stop.

We went to the Magic Kingdom after dinner and did a bunch of the classics. Usually Jungle Cruise has a long wait, so I haven't been on it in years. No wait and the guide was hilarious. The Tiki Room is back to it's classic self and no longer ""under new management."" The Haunted  Mansion also has a new interactive queue. 

Monday, we transferred over to the boardwalk which was a little bit more of a headache than I expected it to be, mostly because Bryan's suitcase broke. They transferred mine for me, but Bryan didn't want them to lose his. That and I made my parents stay in their room so we could leave our stuff in there, but they actually had our room ready. But, we made it, and our luggage and all was well. I got my lunch from Morocco CS and Bryan got sushi from Japan. We mostly hung around world showcase 'cause the future world rides are gettin' a little old. We did see Captain EO again :)

We had dinner at the restaurant formerly known as Spoodles, AKA: Kouzina. We had reservations but waited over half an hour for a table. The manager gave us free appetizers, but then they wouldn't give us our vacation club discount because we didn't have our membership card with us. Every other restaurant accepted our Key to the World card no problem. The food was pretty good, but not amazing. We'll probably skip it next trip.

Tueday we went to Hollywood Studios. No Fantasmic this week, so don't have to worry about crowded Fantasmic days. We were able to get fastpasses for Toy Story really easy and pretty much everything else was walk-on. The new Star Tours is awesome! I was watching the Disney ""Must Do"" channel while I was working out and learned that there are like 50 combinations of scenes you can get, so we went back there on Thursday morning and rode it two more times :D The second time we had almost the exact same ride as the first time, the second was our best tour though :D

We ate lunch at Sci-Fi Tuesday afternoon and had mediocre veggie burgers. The ones we had at Liberty Tree Wednesday were much better. Delicious in fact. One of my favorite meals of the trip. The desserts and ambiance at Sci-Fi are always worth the trip though. Oh, and a little tip, alcohol makes Toy Story Midway Mania extra fun. 

Dinner was on the Boardwalk again, this time at the Flying Fish. My mom and I shared the Mahi Mahi and Scallops. Both were super yummy. That plus the appetizers filled us up too much for dessert. We brought back treats from the bakery instead. 

Wednesday it was back to the Magic Kingdom for those yummy veggie burgers (+sweet potato fries). I think Space Mountain and Splash Mountain get better every year. We should have done Thunder Mountain on Sunday 'cause it was closed. We got our picture with Prince Eric and Ariel, barely. They spent over ten minutes with the same two kids. The girl was like bringing them flowers and stuff. Still love the Laugh Floor. Got to see some of the new Fantasy Land construction. Piglet is still MIA.

We had dinner at the California Grill. As last time, amazing, expensive food. Got to see the fireworks from their observation deck. They didn't have my smores dessert I saw on the online menu though, so that was disappointing. Dessert Friday made up for that, but I'll get to that later. Getting back from the Cali Grill was an experience. When I made the reservation, I thought the Magic Kingdom closed at 9. It had closed early all week at 8. So, we couldn't take a bus back to our hotel from there. We had to go all the way to Downtown Disney and that bus took a whopping 40 minutes to show up.

Thursday we went to Hollywood Studios in the morning and then back to EPCOT. We ate lunch at France on a whim and it turns out my parents had a similar whim as we ran into them there. My dad's cousin also met up with us there. Again, we mostly did the countries. We finally caught up with Brer Fox Bryan and I did Spaceship Earth right before dinner to make funny faces and send ourselves the postcard. We had dinner at the new restaurant in the Mexican Pavilion, La Hacienda de San Angel. It was pretty good, but forgettable. The Margaritas were interesting though.

Friday, we did something we've never done before and left Disney property. OK, we've been to Universal before, but not together. I've only been to Islands of Adventure once, Bryan's never been, and neither one of us has seen the new Harry Potter area, which is awesome btw. The Forbidden Journey ride is not what I expected it to be. After going on the Mummy and MIB, I was a little disappointed and pretty queasy too. Even Bryan felt a little sick after. It was like the goal of the ride was to make you nauseous. We would have loved to spend more time in the gift shops, but they were so incredibly small and crowded. The entire population of the park was in that section. It was pretty crazy.

We decided to have a nice sit-down meal to recover after Forbidden Journey. We went to Mythos which has been named the best theme park restaurant 6 years running. It was pretty damn good. Especially the dessert. Oh golly. Ooey, gooey, chocolate banana cake with caramel and peanut butter ice cream. OMG.

We spent a lot of time in the Dr Sues area. Super cute. Especially the baby on the Cat in the Hat ride wearing the Cat in the Hat hat. That was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen. We bought the hat for Natalie (Bryan's friend Brian's daughter). We also really liked the Hulk coaster which I rode several times last time I was there and now remember why.

We had some small snacks before we left, but mostly we ate ice cream for dinner. We met up with Katie and Rachael again at Beaches :D",I'm Good at This,,,,,,
1/13/2012 23:23,1/14/2012 4:23,"So far I planned our first two days perfectly.

We ate at Raglan Road Saturday night. It's an Irish restaurant in Downtown Disney. After my mom went back and forth with the waitress about 300 times over what items on the menu didn't have alcohol, we finally got some pretty tastey food. After, Bryan and I went to our favorite store there where our favorite artist likes to hang out. He was there. He didn't remember Bryan but he remembered me, ha! 

Sunday was marathon day. I heard the buses would be running behind because they have to reroute traffic, but we made it to the Animal Kingdom fairly quickly.

Putting together our <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/zenphoto/index.php?album=characters"">Disney Character</a> page, I was thinking, I got to have more pics than this. Really, I've been to Disney World 17 frelling times. So, I went through every picture I could find at my parents house and discovered some more :D 

I wish I knew where the rest were. We must have more pictures. Or maybe not, maybe we just have video. There are plenty of pictures of our hotels, items from the backlot tour, the BTTF time machine. Ah well, maybe they'll eventually turn up.

The weather's been nice. Too nice. You know why? Because I bought snow boots and I'm spending three weeks in Florida this winter. My preparedness for snow and my visiting a sunny, warm state has guaranteed good weather for NJ until I get back from my third trip. That's right, I control the weather in the entire tri-state area. You're welcome.

While it's nice I get to go to FL again, this travel approval/arrangement crap is really stressing me out. Maryam doesn't want to be picked up first, Julia and I don't want to sleep on air mattresses, no one wants to wake up at 5:30am, it's really pretty complicated.

Saturday, we had breakfast at Kouzina. I had the French Toast Baklava, which was really more of a dessert than a breakfast, but so good. After breakfast, Bryan wanted to look for Piglet at the Magic Kingdom. The place was packed. Space Mountain had a 110 minute wait and the first time I've seen the People Mover with a line in like 15 years. Splash Mountain didn't have a line though. It was a little chilly. We went on that, didn't get wet. We got fastpasses for Space Mountain and did the laugh floor again. Never did get our picture with Piglet and he's been haunting my dreams.

Dinner was at Ohana where I stuffed myself silly. We went over there early because it was cold and lines were long. At least we figured Bryan could watch football at the bar. I got a sangria which had an awful lot of alcohol for a Disney sangria. I got lost looking for my parents. Dinner was very good though. I really liked the steak and I'm not a big steak person. The dessert was a little too good as well. I told Bryan we had to go to EPCOT and walk back to our hotel so I could use up some of the calories I consumed. It was nice to walk through EPCOT one last time. 

Sunday morning we had breakfast at Kouzina again before departing for the airport. I ordered the same thing :P It was so good! Flight back was just as pleasant as the flight there. Wish I could always fly Jetblue. Cheaper flight, free checked bags, we arrivedmore legroom, they give you the whole can/bottle of your drink, your choice of snacks, free TV <-- why are they so awesome??? I watched some lifetime movie on the way back. Better than doing nothing.

Speaking of awesome, Bryan's parents picked us up from the airport and we went out for some Mexican for dinner. Good times.

We ate at Raglan Road Saturday night. It's an Irish restaurant in Downtown Disney. After my mom went back and forth with the waitress about 300 times over what items on the menu didn't have alcohol, we finally got some pretty tastey food. After, Bryan and I went to our favorite store there where our favorite artist likes to hang out. He was there. He didn't remember Bryan but he remembered me, ha! 

Sunday was marathon day. I heard the buses would be running behind because they have to reroute traffic, but we made it to the Animal Kingdom fairly quickly. Actually, we didn't have to wait for a bus all day. Nor for any rides. The park was pretty empty. We finished so early, we didn't know what to do. No characters we didn't get pictures with already either. We had lunch at Yak and Yeti. Dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Our bus driver missed the exit and had to turn around. Then, at the first stop, we didn't know what the stop was. We asked him if this is where the restaurant was and he didn't know. He said yes, we got off, then he honed and waved us back. No, it's the other stop.

We went to the Magic Kingdom after dinner and did a bunch of the classics. Usually Jungle Cruise has a long wait, so I haven't been on it in years. No wait and the guide was hilarious. The Tiki Room is back to it's classic self and no longer ""under new management."" The Haunted  Mansion also has a new interactive queue. 

Monday, we transferred over to the boardwalk which was a little bit more of a headache than I expected it to be, mostly because Bryan's suitcase broke. They transferred mine for me, but Bryan didn't want them to lose his. That and I made my parents stay in their room so we could leave our stuff in there, but they actually had our room ready. We made it, our luggage and all. I got my lunch from Morocco CS and Bryan got sushi from Japan. We mostly hung around world showcase 'cause the future world rides are gettin' a little old. We did see Captain EO again :)

We had dinner at the restaurant formerly known as Spoodles, AKA: Kouzina. We had reservations but waited over half an hour for a table. The manager gave us free appetizers, but then they wouldn't give us our vacation club discount because we didn't have our membership card with us. Every other restaurant accepted our Key to the World card no problem. The food was pretty good, but not amazing. We'll probably skip it next trip.

Tueday we went to Hollywood Studios. No Fantasmic this week, so don't have to worry about crowded Fantasmic days. We were able to get fastpasses for Toy Story really easy and pretty much everything else was walk-on. The new Star Tours is awesome! I was watching the Disney ""Must Do"" channel while I was working out and learned that there are like 50 combinations of scenes you can get, so we went back there on Thursday morning and rode it two more times :D The second time we had almost the exact same ride as the first time, the second was our best tour though :D

We ate lunch at Sci-Fi Tuesday afternoon and had mediocre veggie burgers. The ones we had at Liberty Tree Wednesday were much better. Delicious in fact. One of my favorite meals of the trip. The desserts and ambiance at Sci-Fi are always worth the trip though. Oh, and a little tip, alcohol makes Toy Story Midway Mania extra fun. 

Dinner was on the Boardwalk again, this time at the Flying Fish. My mom and I shared the Mahi Mahi and Scallops. Both were super yummy. That plus the appetizers filled us up too much for dessert. We brought back treats from the bakery instead. 

Wednesday it was back to the Magic Kingdom for those yummy veggie burgers (+sweet potato fries). I think Space Mountain and Splash Mountain get better every year. We should have done Thunder Mountain on Sunday 'cause it was closed. We got our picture with Prince Eric and Ariel, barely. They spent over ten minutes with the same two kids. The girl was like bringing them flowers and stuff. Still love the Laugh Floor. Got to see some of the new Fantasy Land construction. Piglet is still MIA.

We had dinner at the California Grill. As last time, amazing, expensive food. Got to see the fireworks from their observation deck. They didn't have my smores dessert I saw on the online menu though, so that was disappointing. Dessert Friday made up for that, but I'll get to that later. Getting back from the Cali Grill was an experience. When I made the reservation, I thought the Magic Kingdom closed at 9. It had closed early all week at 8. So, we couldn't take a bus back to our hotel from there. We had to go all the way to Downtown Disney and that bus took a whopping 40 minutes to show up.

Thursday we went to Hollywood Studios in the morning and then back to EPCOT. We ate lunch at France on a whim and it turns out my parents had a similar whim as we ran into them there. My dad's cousin also met up with us there. Again, we mostly did the countries. We finally caught up with Brer Fox in America. Bryan and I did Spaceship Earth right before dinner to make funny faces and send ourselves the postcard. We had dinner at the new restaurant in the Mexican Pavilion, La Hacienda de San Angel. It was pretty good, but forgettable. The Margaritas were interesting though.

Friday, we did something we've never done before and left Disney property. OK, we've been to Universal before, but not together. I've only been to Islands of Adventure once, Bryan's never been, and neither one of us has seen the new Harry Potter area, which is awesome btw. The Forbidden Journey ride is not what I expected it to be. After going on the Mummy and MIB, I was a little disappointed and pretty queasy too. Even Bryan felt a little sick after. It was like the goal of the ride was to make you nauseous. We would have loved to spend more time in the gift shops, but they were so incredibly small and crowded. The entire population of the park was in that section. It was pretty crazy.

We decided to have a nice sit-down meal to recover after Forbidden Journey. We went to Mythos which has been named the best theme park restaurant 6 years running. It was pretty damn good. Especially the dessert. Oh golly. Ooey, gooey, chocolate banana cake with caramel and peanut butter ice cream. OMG.

We spent a lot of time in the Dr Sues area. Super cute. Especially the baby on the Cat in the Hat ride wearing the Cat in the Hat hat. That was just about the cutest thing I've ever seen. We bought the hat for Natalie (Bryan's friend Brian's daughter). We also really liked the Hulk coaster which I rode several times last time I was there and now remember why. A bit chilly today, so we skipped Jurassic Park :( 

We had some small snacks before we left, but mostly we ate ice cream for dinner. We met up with Katie and Rachael again at Beaches :D

Saturday, we had breakfast at Kouzina. I had the French Toast Baklava, which was really more of a dessert than a breakfast, but so good. After breakfast, Bryan wanted to look for Piglet at the Magic Kingdom. The place was packed. Space Mountain had a 110 minute wait and the first time I've seen the People Mover with a line in like 15 years. Splash Mountain didn't have a line though. It was a little chilly. We went on that, didn't get wet. We got fastpasses for Space Mountain and did the laugh floor again. Never did get our picture with Piglet and he's been haunting my dreams.

Dinner was at Ohana where I stuffed myself silly. We went over there early because it was cold and lines were long. At least we figured Bryan could watch football at the bar. I got a sangria which had an awful lot of alcohol for a Disney sangria. I got lost looking for my parents. Dinner was very good though. I really liked the steak and I'm not a big steak person. The dessert was a little too good as well. I told Bryan we had to go to EPCOT and walk back to our hotel so I could use up some of the calories I consumed. It was nice to walk through EPCOT one last time. 

Sunday morning we had breakfast at Kouzina again before departing for the airport. I ordered the same thing :P It was so good! Flight back was just as pleasant as the flight there. Wish I could always fly Jetblue. Cheaper flight, free checked bags, we actually left Newark early, more legroom, they give you the whole can/bottle of your drink, your choice of snacks, free TV <-- why are they so awesome??? I watched some lifetime movie on the way back. Better than doing nothing.

Speaking of awesome, Bryan's parents picked us up from the airport and we went out for some Mexican for dinner. Good times.

Now vacation is over and I didn't miss work at all and it's really, really cold and I want to go back to Disney where it's warm and happy.",Disney 2012,,,,,,
1/20/2012 21:09,0000-00-00 00:00:00,"I don't like tampons. I feel confident in saying this now that I've used them a few times. Only a few times? Well, yes. See, I had attempted tampon use in the past, but I guess tampon anxiety can make it difficult to insert them. I was going to the beach last summer, so I figured, hey, I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm a grown woman, I'm married now, time to give this another shot.

The thing is, I'm on seasonale, so I only get four periods a year. And they're light. Pretty much, I bleed for half a day and the rest of the week is random spotting. Kinda hard to insert and take out a tampon when you're not bleeding much. Still, they make exercising/showering much more convenient, so I try on heavier days.

Despite their convenience, if I was back to a regular period, I still wouldn't be using them much. They're icky. I mean, how do you get it up there without getting blood all over your hand? you can't feel it once it's in, but I know it's there ... absorbing stuff. Then, there's the string which is like an ick magnet. And I gotta touch that thing?

One of my friends was trying to convince us to try the diva cup. It is environmentally friendly and it makes sense, especially since I don't bleed much, but ... If tampons gross me out, I don't think I could handle it. I can't imagine being able to insert the thing, I'm not that coordinated. And if tampons make me gag, I can't imagine emptying and washing it. I would think about trying though, at least once, but it's like $30+?

I think I'll stick to pads.",My Thoughts on Tampons,,,,,,

We were laughing and laughing all week. He said we're in his top five favorite classes of all time, and he's had a lot :D We learned so much too, like really learned. We spliced cable and played with the different meters and things. I feel like if there was a strike, I would actually be useful. Someone else would have to climb the ladder, but I can take care of stuff on the ground ;) 

Outside of class was just as fun. I should go on all my trips with Maryam and Julia. We pretty much spent every day shopping. The first day we got here we went shopping on Las Olas Boulevard, which is a bunch of boutiques. We had a great meal there too. I especially enjoyed my gelato, which I swear was just as good as the good stuff in Rome.

After class every day we headed to the Sawgrass Mills Mall. Huge. Like Palisades huge. We were in heaven. Until we lost Julia. She was missing for a good 20 minutes. We found her just as we were starting to panic. Then we got lost, but at least our cells were working at that point.

We ate there almost every night. We saw Beauty and the Beast on Thursday. We had the theater to ourselves so Julia and I sang through the entire movie.

I did the driving this week. Maryam's renting the car next time. Driving in FL is a lot easier than driving in NJ. It's awesome, you don't have to go around a jug handle to make left hand turns and there are signs telling you what the streets are. Amazing. There's also about half the amount of cars on the road. This left turn system they got going on here I don't think would work with the amount of traffic we have. Makes me want to move to FL. 

The gym here really sucks. Most of the machines are broken, it's been around 90 degrees in there every time I've gone, the lightest weight they have is 25 pounds and they don't have any sort of exercise mats. I've only gone three times this week and have done a much shorter workout than usual. Just enough to keep me sane.

I spent a lot of time the last few weeks filling out my expense report and other administrative tasks, but luckily I have Sean working with me and he's been taking care of most of the project work. I did manage to finish my AD, but that was about it.

We had our girls weekend this past weekend in Parcippany. Mostly we ate and drank a lot of crap. Before the drinking, we went down to the pool for a while. After that, Carolyn and I did some Zumba in the gym. A staff member came in and asked us how old we were. We tell him and he responds, ""are you sure? You don't look that old."" Ass. It's not like we were in there doing something illegal. We made the minimum age by 7 and 8 years, the place was empty and we were exercising. 

When we got back to the room, the rest of the girls were drunk already. We played a couple humorous rounds of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_%28card_game%29"">Kings</a> and then just chatted for a while.

Sunday morning we didn't feel too bad. We had breakfast and hung out a some more before checking out. I spent the rest of the day at my parents'. Took Buffy for a walk, determined my dad's new router had an even worse range than the old router.

We had to get up at 3am for our flight home. Except Julia, who slept through her alarm, and us calling her and me knocking on her door. We eventually got her up and made it to the airport in time. A lady on the plane home took my seat without asking. When I asked to see her ticket she said, ""Oh, my son wants to sit with me."" OK lady, that's nice, but can you tell me your original seat so I can sit somewhere? Of course there was someone in her original seat.

We ate there almost every night. We saw Beauty and the Beast on Thursday. We had the theater to ourselves so Julia and I sang through the entire movie.

We also visited Butterfly World and saw many pretty butterflys and birds.

I did the driving this week. Maryam's renting the car next time. Driving in FL is a lot easier than driving in NJ. It's awesome, you don't have to go around a jug handle to make left hand turns and there are signs telling you what the streets are. Amazing. There's also about half the amount of cars on the road. This left turn system they got going on here I don't think would work with the amount of traffic we have. Makes me want to move to FL. 

The gym here really sucks. Most of the machines are broken, it's been around 90 degrees in there every time I've gone, the lightest weight they have is 25 pounds and they don't have any sort of exercise mats. I've only gone three times this week and have done a much shorter workout than usual. Just enough to keep me sane.

We had our performance reviews via phone this week. I'm glad Roy finally filled out feedback form himself. Best review I've had so far. I'm even eligible for some extra bonus thingy. 

We had to get up at 3am for our flight home. Except Julia, who slept through her alarm, and us calling her and me knocking on her door. We eventually got her up and made it to the airport in time. A lady on the plane home took my seat without asking. When I asked to see her ticket she said, ""Oh, my son wants to sit with me."" OK lady, that's nice, but can you tell me your original seat so I can sit somewhere? Of course there was someone in her original seat. I was standing around for a while until the flight attendant sorted things out. I was hoping they'd put me in first class, but no such luck. I slept most of the trip anyway.

Then we went to Cheryl's party and I wore my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Irregular-choice-Abigails-Burgandy-Womens/dp/B005P9SLWA"">fancy new shoes</a>.",CP12 Part1,,,,,,

He said we're in his top five favorite classes of all time, and he's had a lot :D We learned so much too, like really learned. We spliced cable and played with the different meters and things. I feel like if there was a strike, I would actually be useful. Someone else would have to climb the ladder, but I can take care of stuff on the ground ;)

We had our safety course and they didn't make me carry or climb the ladder which I was pretty happy about. I spent a lot of time the last few weeks filling out my expense report and other administrative tasks, but luckily I have Sean working with me and he's been taking care of most of the project work. I did manage to finish my AD, but that was about it.

We had our girls weekend this past weekend in Parcippany. Mostly we ate and drank a lot of crap. Before the drinking, we went down to the pool for a while. After that, Carolyn and I did some Zumba in the gym. A staff member came in and asked us how old we were. We tell him and he responds, ""are you sure? You don't look that old."" Ass. It's not like we were in there doing something illegal. We made the minimum age by 7 and 8 years, the place was empty and we were exercising. 

When we got back to the room, the rest of the girls were drunk already. We played a couple humorous rounds of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_%28card_game%29"">Kings</a> and then just chatted for a while.

Sunday morning we didn't feel too bad. We had breakfast and hung out a some more before checking out. I spent the rest of the day at my parents'. Took Buffy for a walk, determined my dad's new router had an even worse range than the old router.

3/7/2012 20:38,3/8/2012 1:38,"Back to Fort Lauderdale we went for more training. The class itself was a lot more boring and longer since they condensed 5 days into 4 so we could have Saturday off. Since we got out later, we couldn't do much in the evening besides eat. Eating's always fun though. We Went to Las Olas again and ate at Mangos again and I got gelato after again. We also gorged ourselves on Indian food again. A better, more expensive place this time.

We saved on lunch this trip by eating leftovers a lot. We stayed at a different hotel so we had a fridge this time. We also had a stove and decided to cook a couple of times. I made rice and salad. Most of my specialties are things Maryam or Julia can't eat or involve an oven, which we didn't have. We shared one of the meals with our instructors who were staying at our hotel. They made steak. 

Saturday we went to the beach with Patti and Minling who were also there for training. We went to Hollywood Beach and hung out at the edge of the pretty blue water for a while before looking for the boardwalk. And walk we did. A very long walk from where we parked. They really need more garages down there. It's like trying to find a spot in Hoboken. Once we found the stores, we spent a lot of money :) I bought a cute, Disney sundress. And ice cream. OMG. Ice cream always tastes best when you're hot and dehydrated.

We at dinner at this fancy place everyone had recommended. Patti ordered a drink and I was peer pressured into ordering one too. My bill came to exactly $42 (our daily limit), though before tip, so I left cash. Their carrot cake was amazing and so worth every penny over. 

Our flight back didn't leave until 8:35pm Sunday night, so we spent the day shopping at a mall near the airport. I got some cute things, but the best part about the mall was Seasons 52. I've wanted to try this place since I first read about it on <a href=""http://www.pbfingers.com/2011/01/13/sure-ill-have-the-quail/"">Julie</a>'s blog. Definitely lived up to its reputation :)

And then it was time to head home. Night flights are pretty neat, watching the lights and all, you know, when you're not over the ocean, but so not worth how tired I was Monday. I worked from home, but I was completely useless in the morning before my lunchtime nap. My brain was functioning much better after that.

10:57am<br />
You wake up. You're a little disoriented after the dream you just had. Something about being a photographer for the mob and crocodiles in the streets/water and leaving your laptop in Andrew's car so you couldn't do a Day in the Life. ...Weird. Bryan gives you a kiss and tells you
he loves you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic1.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic1s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You slept over his house last night. You slept really well too. Nine hours straight. You were really tired after getting only a few hours the night before. Stupid dorm room.
<br />You feel a little sore, so you stretch. What the frell are you sore from, doing laundry? You grab all your little toiletries and head to the bathroom. You brush your teeth, wash your face, put... wait, where are your contacts? You go back into the room to get them, careful not to disturb Bryan who's still sleeping. You put into your contacts and put on your face goop.
<br />You come back and start typing this on his computer in gmail. He wakes up and tells you he loves you. He gets up, looks to see what you're doing and asks, ""did you take a picture while I was sleeping?"" Yes you did!
<br />You check your mail. Your daddy sent you something about a job on Dice, but you don't think you're qualified. You also have one to do a survey for PineCone. Yay, another $5.
<br />Byran says we go eat. He tells you to put on pants so you won't be cold. What?? You wore shorts to bed. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic2.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic2s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You both eat some ""Honey Nut Scooters."" Bryan points out that it's snowing. Something that's been pretty rare this year. He looks through the newspaper. He makes comments about the job postings. He asks you if anyone died from your school while you were going there. You're not sure.
<br />You go back upstairs. Bryan wants to play a game, ""Feeding Frenzy."" He sings a little song, ""You're my Lissy, you're my Lissy, and I love you, and I love you."" You watch him play. You comment that you think Insaniquarium is better. He says, maybe it gets harder, it's just the beginning of the game. He says he loves Lissy. You say that you're not gonna write down every time he says it cause he says it a lot. He gets eaten. He comes over and gives you a kiss. He says he shocked you, you didn't notice anything. You see if there's any good posts over at LifeHacker. Hmm, ""Questions couples wish they'd asked before saying 'I do.'"" Hmm, the link doesn't work. Oh, now it does. Bryan comes back from the bathroom and you show him. Yeah, we've already talked about all that stuff. That and whether we're gonna tell our kid that Santa's real. He asks you where you class is, you say Hardenburg. He says you can walk then. You give him pouty face. He's joking. You put your hair in a ponytail since you don't have a brush. You put your necessities in your laptop case. You hug for a whiles before you leave. You put your hair down again since it looks bad anyways. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic3.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic3s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>

<br /><br />1:06pm

<br />Bryan drops you off in front of your building. You thank him and kiss him goodbye. You're getting to class over 15 minutes later than usual, yet there's still almost no one there yet. Yay for cold weather. You get a seat by the outlet. You put down your lappy, plug it in and get out your homework. People come in. Your teacher comes in 5 minutes late and hands back your journals from last week. This is Philosophy of Psychology by the way. 10/10, ""good points!"" she says. We're talking about Functionalism, again, today because apparently people don't get it. Wtf? You delete the spam from your gmail. You browse facebook. You check the weather, high of 27 today. Supposed to snow a little more later. You start the PineCone survey. Bleh, another one of the stupid shopping trip surveys. You hate those, they take forever to load. Ooooor, maybe it won't load at all. There it goes. Great, now we're talking about parity and making finite state tables and diagrams. Cause you haven't done that to death already. You visit CuteOverload.com, SoapOperaFan.com, ShinyShiny.tv, mySpace. You're hungry. You visit DMB. Class is over, you drop off your homework at the front and head to the bus stop.

<br /><br />2:32pm
<br />You run over to the bus stop to up your body temperature and 'cause you saw a bus coming. Not yours though. You eat your milk and cereal bar while you're waiting. You check the next bus sign, says the H should be here soon. You decide to go to the dining hall before class since you should have enough time and you're still hungry. Usually you eat before your philosophy class. The bus comes, but it's really crowded so you have to stand. 'Least you have something to hold onto this time.
<br />You arrive on Busch. A girl gets off at the first stop and you take her seat. You get off at the student center and walk to the dining hall. They have a weird tent-like thing covering the entrance. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic4.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic4s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You get fajitas and a salad. They have the oreos for the frozen yogurt today which makes you mad because you don't have much time, it's cold out, and you'll be eating chocolate tonight. You get some after you eat anyway though, just a little, cause you have no will power.
<br />You leave the dining hall and walk through the student center stopping at the bathroom. You walk to your next class, Health Psychology, in the Pharmacy Building. You stop in ARC for a second to warm up.

<br /><br />3:16pm
<br /><a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic5.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic5s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at class with a couple minutes to spare. Your usual seat is taken though, so you sit somewhere in the middle. She made a study guide??? Yeesh. And she's going to do a review. What did you study yesterday for? A Jeopardy style review, with dark chocolate as prizes. You don't like dark chocolate. She goes onto the lecture about ethnic and racial disparities in health care. You play Insaniquarium Deluxe which you downloaded yesterday. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic6.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic6s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a> It's stupid question answering time. Every once in a while the professor has you answer a couple of questions and turn in the answer for a point of credit. You pack up your stuff, hand in your answers and grab a few of the leftover chocolates to give to Bryan, though after you realize they'll probably melt before you see him. You leave and head to ARC to meet with your group to discuss your web applications project.

<br /><br />4:30pm
<br />There's a class in the room you're supposed to me in, so you go to the bathroom while you wait and then play Insaniquarium to kill some more time. You go back to the classroom since the class should be ending. The TA that's teaching is the same TA you had for Calc2 freshman year. You take a seat, plug in your lappy and eat one of the chocolates. They're not too bad. You play game again.
<br />Someone in your class arrives. You show him the slides you made. Other people show up. You go over stuffs. They comment on your cute sTabLauncher thing. You decide to go to Serc to look at open source games on the internet. One of the members of your group isn't there yet, so you leave a note on the blackboard.
<br />You arrive in Serc, Carolyn calls you and asks when you're meeting up for the <i>Chocolat</i> thing. You tell her you're with your group and still have to shower. You'll call her when you're done. The other member e-mailed all of you to say you're late. You tell him you moved to Serc. You look through games. One crossword puzzle keeps freezes your computer. You decide on one game, you'll have to look some more for others. One of the group members has to leave for class. You have to leave too.

<br />You call Carolyn on the way back to your room. You tell her to meet you at ARC around 7:15. You rush back to your dorm.

<br /><br />6:40pm
<br />You arrive at your dorm and turn on the hot water since it takes a while to get warm. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic7.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic7s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You plug in your lappy and get you robe and towel and then shower. Ten minutes later you're back in the room. You don't have much time to get ready. You call Carolyn and tell her you're getting dressed and that you should meet at the student center. You get dressed, but it's too hot, so you take off your sweater and sit around in your bra. Eh, the door's locked.
<br />Bryan calls and says he ate and he's gonna take a shower and then pick you up. You put on a t-shirt and go to turn down the thermostat, but it's already at 74. You watch TV while you wait.

<br /><br />7:20pm
<br />Bryan calls and tells you he's on his way. You pack up your stuff, put on your sweater, and go downstairs and wait for him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic8.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic8s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>He gets there a little whiles later. You tell him he's the bestest boyfriend for bringing your bag and going to the chocolate thing with you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic9.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic9s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at the student center and, er, you're the first ones there. You thought it would be more crowded. Hundreds of people came to the Hypnotism thing. You find a seat by an outlet and wait. Bryan loveses you. <-- he wrote that while you went to the bathroom. Carolyn calls you. She says the nextbus thing says the RexB won't come for another 14 minutes. She sees one coming! People start getting chocolate, so you go up and get some. You get seconds as they start the movie, it's very yummy. Carolyn calls a few times, you go fetch her from outside the room. Bryan rubs your back, feel good. Your daddy IMs you and asks if it's snowing yet and if he should pick you up. Your friends laugh because your daddy says,""nite nite :-) dada loves u. did u get momma anything 4 valentines day. i did."" Carolyn wants to go back for seconds, so you get thirds :P Bryan says, ""is that your dinner?"" You nod. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic10.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic10s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>Your hands are now sticky so you go rinse them off. You put some chapstick on. You give Bryan a kiss. Andrew IMs you. He doesn't believe Carolyn's with you. She's proves it by telling him where her butt is. *shrugs*

<br /><br />10:11pm
<br />The movie's over, so you clean up your stuff and leave. You say goodbye to Carolyn and walk with Bryan to his car. On the way there, he tells you he liked the movie. You're glad. You were worried he wouldn't like it 'cause it's kinda a chick flick. You arrive at the car. Unfortunately it iced all over the it and Bryan has to scrape it off. You wait for a while for the car to warm up. This is unfortunate since you have to use the bathroom. Bryan decides it's a good time to give you your valentines day present. He puts his hat over your eyes so you can't see while he takes the tag off. He takes the hat off, it's an adorable mug. You have the cutest boyfriend. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic11.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic11s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>
<br />You go back to your room so you can give him his presies. You give him his chocolate and the presie you made him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic12.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic12s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgFhawKD-U0"" target=""_blank"">See the video.</a>

<br />He looks at your cognitive science book since you two were talking about it last night. He makes a face. You thank each other for being wonderful and for the presies. You hear Amina complain it's so hot even though the heat's so low. You say, ""I know, isn't it!"" You walk Bryan to the door. He turns the heat down, but you put it back up since you think Emily would just do it later anyway. You and Bryan kiss goodbye. You watch him walk down the stairs and wave, then close the door.

<br /><br />10:55pm
<br />You sit at your computer and put on Sex and the City. Carolyn IMs you a little while later. She finally made it back to her dorm. You upload all the pictures you took today. Bryan IMs you ""<3"" Your computer freezes so you have to reboot. You watch Will and Grace. Emily comes back. You check your e-mail. Helen sent out a flier for the WCS meeting Thursday. No one's gonna go to that thing. Emily suddenly shouts ""oh my God! I didn't tell you guys!"" and runs into the other room. You: *shifty eyes* You watch Friends. You edit your life.php file to make it easier to navigate. Emily sneezes, you say, ""bless you."" You can't see the video you uploaded to youtube :( You watch Frasier. You play Insaniquarium again. You take your pills. You're tummy's not very happy about eating chocolate for dinner. 
<br />You go brush your teeth. Emily asks you if you're going out, you tell her you already did. She asks if you're going out tomorrow. You say you're not sure since you have class until late and he has to get up early the next day, though you're gonna try and meet for dinner. You wash your face and put on your face goop. Great, you're getting a new zit. You're nose is a little runny too, you hope you're not getting sick. Your roommates are all sick.
<br />You read a post on ForeverGeek.com about the ""The 10 Greatest Sci-Fi Franchises of All Time"" and Farscape isn't on the list! 'Least Firefly is. You leave a comment. You visit your livejournal friends and comment on Katie's blog. Emily tells you that she's getting roses tomorrow and her ""friend"" is coming over and if he asks, the roses are yours. 

<br /><br />1:40am
<br />You read Chau's blog. You feel sleepy and you're barely concentrating on reading it. You decide to get ready for bed. You take out your contacts and put on your PJs. You wish you were sleeping over Bryan's again. It's so much fun just talking to him. You clean off your bed to make room for sleeping. Your tummy really isn't happy. You go grab a water. You set your alarm for 11:00 since you have an interview at 12 tomorrow for SHI. Hopefully you won't be thinking about it all night and you'll be able to sleep. You put your computer to sleep and them yourself. Night!

<br /><br />7 something? Anyway, way too early
<br/>Your roommate wakes you up. You're awake for a little bit before drifting off to sleep again. You have a dream that your alarm goes off at 11 instead of 8:30 and you miss your first class X( You're not all that upset cause you could miss that class. But you're still relieved to find it was just a dream. You had another dream that you were inside a video game or something with your friends. That was kinda cool. 

<br /><br />8:30am

<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic1.jpg"" align=""left"">Your alarm goes off. No wanna get up! You get up anyway. You notice the toilet paper is once again, not on the roll. For some reason, no one seems to want to put it on anymore besides you. Well, that garbage is getting awfully full. You wonder when it's your turn to clean again. You lost track, you always do. We need a calendar or something. 
<br/>You brushy your teeth, washy your face, put in contacts, all that fun stuff. Gotta put on all your face goop too. You notice the big TV's gone. Pooey. You don't bother making your bed since you'll be washing your sheets when you get back. Makeup today? Nah, not worth it. Yoga? Not on Thursdays, no time, you have class in an hour. You get dressed. Something warm, it's cold out. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic3.jpg"" align=""right"">Brush your hair, put on your shoes, pack up your laptop and head out to the dining hall. You take a quick picture of yourself first. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic2.jpg"" align=""left"">You are almost out the front door when you realize you forgot your philosophy book. You run back upstairs to grab it. You can't find it, you start to panic a little, wait, wait, there it is, under your psych book, heh. You head out to the dining hall again, now a few minutes behind schedule. You walk quickly to make up for the time and because it so cold out. You're awfully tired by the time you get there.
<br/>They never have anything good for breakfast and even if they did, it'd still be bad. You get what looks like it could be an everything bagel and some cream cheese and a glass of milk. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic4.jpg"" align=""right"">You get a seat and take off your gear. You have ten minutes to eat. You pick off pieces of the bagel and dip it in the cream cheese. More efficient eating this way.
<br/>You're done eating and is time to go, so you go outside and wait for an A bus. You know it'll be a little while since you just saw one leave. You put on some chapstick. One comes a couple of minutes later. You walk out quickly, wait for everyone to get off, you're the first one on so you get a seat, whee. You hate standing on the bus. Buses were not made for short people. More like swinging than standing. Aw, a guy stands up so someone else could sit down. You like people like that. People that really bug you are the ones who don't back up so more people can get on the bus, or even worse, when someone takes up more than one seat.
<br/>Ten minutes later, you're on College Ave. You stay on the bus instead of walking because, it's cold out, the bus isn't that crowded and really, it doesn't take much longer and you still have plenty of time. Besides, it's the class after an exam, there won't be too many people there anyway.

<br /><br />9:39
<br/>You arrive at your first class of the day: Intro to Logic, under the dorms. You're not sure why you bother coming since you learned all this stuff back in Discrete I, but it gives you time to read blogs and chat with your friends before your 11:30 class. You were right, not a lot of people here. You feel like having a piece of gum, but you can't find any in your pockets. You take your usual seat in the back by the outlet, plug in your lappy and wake it up. It takes a while, but it does... and then reboots... The thing has a mind of its own. Well, it hasn't been rebooted in a few days. It's done doin' its thing. You start typin'. OK, so you cheated a little. Actually it's 11:03pm the night before and you're typing out some of this ahead of time because you know you don't have much time in the morning. So you fix it up, add in little details. --/end cheat--
<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic5.jpg"" align=""left"">Your professor announces you learn proof today: ""direct proof and indirect proof."" You're still typing, you don't pay much attention, not that you have to. You decide maybe you should take some notes anyway since he tests on definitions. You decide to look for some gum again, you find some this time and have a piece. You have to clean out your flash card so you have room for lotsa pictures today. You decide to connect to the wireless internet too. ""Connected to RUWireless, Signal Strength: Excellent."" You log in. You have a myRutgers Alert? For what??? Oh right, our new RUID's. Ya, they don't wanna use our social security numbers anymore, so we gotta memorize a whole new number. They didn't even assign them yet. Just telling us they will. Like we didn't see the first 15 announcements.
<br/>Your professor's drawing weird lookin' animals on the board. He's so strange. You check your nation, The Spiffy Society of Short Sheep on Nation States. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic6.jpg"" align=""right"">""UN Category: Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Civil Rights: Excellent, Economy: Good, Political Freedoms: Very Good. ... Short Sheep is ranked 10th in the region and 2,249th in the world for Largest Welfare Programs (per capita)."" Your computers flashing a lot of errors at you today... You read peoples' away messages. ""Away,"" ""Bleh"" guess Tom's still in a bad mood, ""Away,"" Emily has a longer one..., ""Away,"" ""Away."" *sigh* You spit out your gum. This class is so boring. Not as boring as Operating Systems though. He's talking about Mormons. o_O Grr, you really gotta learn to stop picking at your lips. Bad Lissy! You still do it even though you yell at yourself. Compulsive much? You put on chapstick. Your professor wants you to answer all the problems in the book. Ya, that'll happen.
<br/>Class is over, you pack up your stuff and leave.

<br /><br />11:10am
<br/>You walk over to your next class two buildings down and make a quick stop in the bathroom before going to your class. Ew, someone left a mess all over the one toilet seat. You wait for the other one. The hand dryer thingy doesn't work either. *sigh* You dry your hands on your pants.
<br/>Your second class of the day: Philosophy of Mind. In the same room number as the other class, just in a different building. Again, you take a seat in the back by the outlet. You'll need your battery power to type when you go visit Carolyn. You sit down and wake up your computer. The guy you went to HS with walks in. He hasn't said anything to you so far this semester. You doubt he even remembers you. You never talked in HS, why start now?

<br/>You log onto the wireless network. Would you stop picking at your lips! Has become such a bad habit now that you don't pick at your nails as much. That calcium you've been taking has made them stronger. Unfortunately you now take your stress out on your poor lips.
<br/>Your professor arrives a few minutes late. You check your site for comments. Oooh, new comments :D You put on your away message saying you're in class. You actually have to pay attention in this one. It's more interesting than your other three too. Also far less work than your writing class last year. Like one teeny reading a week, two papers and two exams. Speaking of which, he's going to pass around suggested topics for the first paper. It's due in two weeks. You add the date to your calendar. You sign the sign in sheet. Students are arguing with the professor about when the midterm's going to be. Right now it's the day after break is over. The class votes to change it to that Thursday instead. Wish that was an option for Data Structures Sophomore year, but your professor didn't schedule that exam, the stupid school did. 
<br/>Going over the Lewis reading today. Didn't we do that last week? Ned Block's the next class? Wasn't that supposed to be today? Wow we go slow. Hey, less reading for you. You take notes.<img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic8.jpg"" align=""right""> Gmail tells you you have a new e-mail from the housing people. No, you don't want to live in Rockoff next year, you already have an apartment. Oops, you missed something, what does that say? Anew or Fade? No... You stare at it for a while. Oh! True or False! Another new e-mail from the creation people telling you there's one more day to order autographed photos. People are debating about Phantom Limbs. You put on your jacket because you're cold. These people are entertaining. Eh, you picked at your finer and now it's bleeding a little. Wow, he's not gonna let you out early today? That's a first. You were just about to IM Carolyn when she IMs you. You tell her he's gonna let you go soon (ya, he lets you out a little early) and you'll be there in like 30/40 minutes or so.
<br/>You walk very quickly to the EE bus stop because it COLD OUT! Not easy to do since it's mostly uphill. But get there just as a bus is pulling up. You wait until the loaded bus almost completely empties and finally you get on and take a seat. Nice and warm :D A couple minutes later, the bus leaves for Douglass.

<br /><br />1:07pm
<br/>You arrive at the bus stop by the dining hall and call Carolyn to let her know you're here. You wait for her inside for a second. She tells you she's getting sick. Uh ohs. You get some sort of chicken, tofu and fried rice plus a salad :P You sit with Carolyn's friends. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic9.jpg"" align=""left"">They mostly talk about music stuff. You finish eating and start type as Carolyn chats with Pedro. You suggest getting frozen yogert. You do. Yummy strawberry with oreos! Frozen yogurt goooood. 
<br/>After eating and chatting, you walk over to Carolyn's dorm. You say you dunno if you wanna sit on the germ infested bed. You do anyway. You'll probably catch her cold regardless. You like her bed. It much higher than yours. That cool. You talk about the new RUID numbers. Carolyn's like, how we supposed to memorize this? You say the same way you memorized your social security number. She tries to convince you it's not the same. She visits cuteoverload.com. You log onto RUWireless. You comment that it says the signal's very good today, usually it says it pretty bad. You say maybe it depends on where you are in the room since you're about a foot away from where you usually sit. You test to see if there's a lag now that you both have Trillian, there is. You chat back and forth online, lol. You check your site comments. New one from Mere. He he, ""Hooray for finding a home! Although, boxes can be nice too. =)"" You start reading this to Carolyn and get to the part about your book. You think... hey, where is your book. You look around you. Uh oh. You and Carolyn go back to the dining hall to get it. That damn book causes more trouble! We didn't even use it today! From now on you're scanning the readings in.
<br/>You ask the lady if anyone found a Philosophy book. She says yesterday, but no, this was today. She lets you go look for it. You find it on the table where you left it surrounded by confused peoples. You walk back to Carolyn's dorm. You ask her if she wants to watch the end of Passions. She puts it on for you :) Grr, stupid spam IMs! You watch some weird flash animation. You watch the silly Harry Potter animation. You get an e-mail: Tutor's Wanted. Great grammar there. You wonder if that's something you should think about doing.

<br /><br />3:00pm
<br/>Time to go. You got laundry and homework to do. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic11.jpg"" align=""left"">Carolyn walks you outside and you see the F bus. You try to run and catch it, but no, too late. Oh well. Carolyn waits with you until an EE comes. Should you get off at the last stop and wait for a REXB or take the EE to College Ave and wait for an A or an H. You decide, since it's not too cold, waiting for an REXB is the better choice since it's faster... most of the time. And that bus stop is the warmest one out of all of them. The sun hits it just right or something. Always like 10 degrees warmer there. So you get off and you wait. And you wait, and you wait. You see several REXBs and Ls pass by in the other direction. Finally, after almost 30 minutes, one finally comes down your way. You notice your daddy called at some point so you listen to his message and call him back to tell him yes, you are taking the train back with Carolyn tomorrow and no, you do not have off until spring vacation X( 
<br/>You take the bus back to Busch and get off at the Serc stop since it doesn't go by the dorms. You walk back. Finally, 3:45 you make it back to your dorm. You ask your suitemates if they know whose week it is to clean. No one seems to have any idea. That makes you feel a bit better. And you didn't particularly want to clean the toilet anyway.
<br/<!--more-->>But you do have to do your laundry. You separate your clothes: Stuff that needs to be washed today, other stuff that doesn't so much. You go to the machines. Someone has stuff in the dryer, but the wash is free, so you put your stuff in. It'll be done at 4:35. You go back to your room and hook up your computer. Cynthia comes in (that's your roommate by the way) and you tell her that no one seems to know whose week it is to clean. She said she just saw Deyo cleaning this morning. But, you just asked her. OK, whatever, we clean next week. You should do your homework, or at least scan in those readings so you don't have to worry about your stupid book anymore. You do that. Well that was more trouble than it's worth. 

<br /><br />4:35pm

<br />You go take your stuff out of the wash, put it in the dryer and put your next load in. They'll be done at 5:20. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic14.jpg"" align=""right"">You look at your copies, they look pretty bad. Why couldn't they have an online book. Bleh. You go put two bottles of water in the fridge so Adi doesn't have to drink warm water again.
<br />You're sleepy all of a sudden. How you supposed to do homework when you're sleepy? You don't wanna do your programming assignment! You check out Shiny Shiny. Wow, a <a href=""http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2006/02/icool_smelly_mp.html"" target=""_blank"">Scented MP3 Player</a>. You go to your mySpace to listen to Banana Phone which Krissy dared you to put on your profile yesterday. You go read friends' LJs. Your LJ isn't pretty anymore since they disabled your layout for some reason. Something about security? They did it to a bunch of people. Ya know, maybe if we didn't have to use the stupid overrides and could just use normal CSS code like the rest of the universe, there wouldn't be a problem! You go check out deviantArt. No one's uploaded anything new... Well you can't start your homework now. You gotta go get your laundry in a few minutes. You check what the dining hall's gonna have for dinner. You see there's a speed dating thing on College Ave tonight. Hmm, naw. You already refused to go to Douglass to make chocolate with Carolyn, she'd kill you if you went to that instead. Besides, Adi's coming over for Farscape. They have another one the 28th. Well that's after Valentines Day, that kinda defeats the purpose, lol. 

<br /><br />5:20pm
<br />You go and fetch your clothes. There's a guy there waiting to do his laundry and is probably quite relieved to see you. Lotsa people doin' their laundry today. He says he likes your slippers. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic15.jpg"" align=""left"">:P You take your clothes out of the dryer and put your next load in. 6:00 you gotta check again. You decide maybe you should start the programming assignment. You write it out on paper first. You think better on paper. The other day, the TA told you to do it a different way from what your professor said, so you gotta look up the function he told you to use in your notes. Hmm... you better look some stuff up. This fork stuff is every so slightly more complicated than the I/O stuff and since you don't exactly pay attention during lecture, you're not 100% sure what you're doing, but the site you look up makes things a bit clearer. Now you just gotta program it. You go to fetch your laundry first.<img src=""http://www.sil",,,,,,,

 it's every time you copy something that you get an error from the google bar dictionary thing. It's 7:05," you're supposed to call Adi and leave him a message to remind him to come over since he can't remember on his own. You do. You put your phone on ring so you'll actually know when he calls and not make him sit in his car for 20 minutes before you realize you're a ditz. You only did it once... <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic17.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">Almost done writing your program. This really is easy. Not that you're complaining or anything. Nothing wrong with easy. You don't feel like running it right now. You'll wait until like Monday or Tuesday for that. Yeah... Though that leaves you with nothing to do... You can uh... comb your hair! Anything to keep from doing homework.",,,,,,,,
 that reminds you, you never looked up the dinner menu even though you said you were going to... anyway, he says we can have popcorn. You explain that popcorn isn't dinner and that you could lend him money. He says no. Pfft. Whatever, your hair isn't even dry yet and you're in ur PJ bottoms,,,,,,
 you were going to go check when your advisor has office hours tomorrow. Since you're gonna be here on a Friday morning, may as well go. You dunno if you should bother. They're pretty clear about requirements and you're pretty sure you've completed them all, well, except the number of credits. And they don't help with major/minor requirements anyway. Though she may know some easy classes you can take next semester as fillers...,,,,,,

" it's been about 40 minutes since he called... Two minutes later the phone rings. Gah! It makes you jump! lol. Adi's here. You go and fetch Adi and tell him about your a Day in the Life of Lissy. And that the big TV is missing. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic20.jpg"""" align=""""right"""">He tells you he's not going to read all this", he's just gonna scroll down to the part about him. Eh, probably only your mommy will read the whole thing. Hi mommy. You plug in the DVD player to watch Farscape, on the little TV. You bring your laptop in too and put on the first episode of season 3.,,,,,,
 sad ending, Zahn :( Ep's over. You put in the popcorn and take the water out of the fridge. Adi asks if you'd want to do a website if he got another artist for another comic, you say ya. He asks how will we know when the popcorn's done, you say when it's done or two seconds between pops. It beeps,,,,,,
 but hey, it's Farscape. A bad episode of Farscape is better than a good episode of any other show. Episode is kinda depressing though. Adi makes a bad joke about Virginia's makeup and her bad reaction to it cause her character isn't doin' so good. Some of your suitemates walk by and say hi. Cynthia asks Adi about his motorcycle. ,,,,,,,,

He's shocked. You roommate puts on Sex and the City. How could you have forgotten about Sex and the City??? Greg says he's going to bed, you shoulda messaged earlier. But you was watchin' the Farscape. Aw, you wrote about your puppies too :( You miss your puppies. Usually you're home with them by now. Oh,,,,,,

 it's cold :(, you pick up your Jornada and start typing this. You also turn on your laptop. You finally get out of bed and put your hair up and put your robe and sandals on.

 Economy: thriving, Political Freedoms: world benchmark. Not bad :) First in the region for Largest Trout Farming Sector too. Cool. You were number one yesterday for best weather as well. Yes, still, no life. You have one outstanding issue that you take care of. You dismiss it.,,,,,,
 you lost... You try again. You got one again. This game sucks. You play one more time and then you'll give up. One yet again. OK, that's enough np wasted. You spin the Wheel of Excitement to try and win some of those np back, but you just loose some more. Ah well, you'll play a game later. You've run out of sites to visit. You decide to watch TV and play Mynci Volleyball since it's 2x the neopoints today. Aw,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 put on your jacket and watch the last few minutes of Sliders. After it's over you quickly rush out the door since you now have only 12 minutes to get to class. You walk more swiftly than usual and arrive at class with 5 minutes to spare. You sit in your usual spot, two rows up and two seats in. You take out your Jornada. The kid sitting by you asks if it does wireless, you sadly reply, no. Two minutes left. Some dude walks in the classroom who isn't the professor and starts erasing the board... sub? You have something in your eye. Beh,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 so you chew on a piece of sugar free spearmint gum. You finished the second chapter of the book and cross that reading off of your list of readings to do. You play solitaire while you wait for class to start. Your TA arrives and you all hand in your homework. You take out a pencil. Class begins. He goes over the homework. You picked the broken pencil again, you take out another one. You doodle. You run out of doodle room again, so you play solitaire. One card from winning. Frell. Oh well. You start a new game. Lost again. You keep playing. You messed up your homework a little, oops. Looks like you're not the only one. Hey,,,,,,

 two cars decided to park very close to each other. You walk around one of the cars instead, carefully so you don't slip on the ice. Someone is coming out of the dorm as you and a few other people arrive. You don't have to swipe your card again :) The construction peoples and their equipment are gone too. You walk upstairs and to your dorm which is unlocked again. You don't hear anyone, but there's probably someone here.,,,,,,,

 thatâs next month too. Cory asks if he can call you later. You remind him youâre writing every detail of your life today down. Also that Gilmore Girls is on at 8 and you have to take a shower before then. He asks if he can call after, but Sex in the City is on ? He doesnât know if his dad will let him call. You check your mail again. Your daddy e-mailed you back about transferring your site. He said we can do Friday. And he also said your database book came! Yay! You tell Cory he can call during Sex in the City. You usually never really watch it anyway since youâre always doing something on the computer. Plus, youâd rather talk to him today than tomorrow since you have the quiz to study for. He goes to ask his dad. You IM Greg a silly emoticon. Coryâs daddy said he can call, lol. He says youâre hard to negotiate with. Well,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you get out of the shower, dry off and head back to your room. You go back on the computer and take off your away message. Hmm, Word isnât behaving, grr. You chat with Greg and Cory some more while waiting for Gilmore Girls to start. Youâre craving Fudge Oreos,,,,,,
 lol. You put them in and poor yourself some water and take it back to the room. Now thereâs a commercial. On your way back to the Oreos your roommateâs friend passes by and you wave. You take the Oreos back to your room. Oh they look so good. Oh they taste so good. Soooo good. Coryâs nervous about talking to you. Ya, youâre way scary. ,,,,,,,,

You watch Sex in the City and surf Blog Explosion as you chat. You spray on leave in conditioner and comb your hair. You watch Judging Amy. Youâre kinda bored.

Pfft. âA personal blog that probably won't be of much interest outside of friends and immediate family.â Obviously they never met Cory. You complain to Greg about them.

 channel 51 and turn it to face you so you can play on Neopets while you watch. You visit your guild (www.avatar.com) on your sn imLissy that you just made a new layout for yesterday. You're not the leader of the guild, but you do have a comphy council position. Yes, you still don't have a life... On your other account yesterday," you were finally able to score some Tiki Armour for the Pant Devil Taunt av. You shall refresh a lot in a few minutes to try and get it. Ew """"State of the A.R.T"""" not the best Sliders ep ever... It's still kinda cold in here",,,,,,

 through the Busch Suites (where hopefully you'll be living next year)," <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/2lifepic3.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">through the field by the dining hall where they're doing some construction so you have to take the long way around through the parking lot", though the engineering field to SERC and up the stairs to the classroom where you now sit. You were early, only about 4 out of the 100 people or so were here,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 the ARC bathroom, where the evil automatic toilets live that either flush while you're still on them or don't bother to flush at all. Unfortunately, you pick the first kind today, eep. You then leave and walk to your classroom where in about 20 minutes or so,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you don't have lab tomorrow because of your exam Thursday, so you have extra time to do it. Tonight you can either study for Physics or do Calc homework. Hmm... which is the lesser of two evils? 10 minutes left. You're very bored. You would doodle, but you use your Jornada to type notes for this class and not so much fun doodling with a stylus. You check how much battery power you have left. 9/10," perty good. You decide you can listen to some music. You have some songs from your Walt Disney World soundtrack and the <i>Wicked</i> soundtrack on your flash card. You detach your headphones from your MP3 player and plug them in. You open up Windows Media Player and listen to """"Dancing Though Life"""" from <i>Wicked</i>. Your professor comes in",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
" unlock the door and go inside. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/2lifepic6.jpg"""" align=""""right"""">Rachelle is sitting at her computer playing The Sims. You complain about your CS grade. You take off your coat and sweat shirt since it's like 90 degrees", with the window open too. What else is new though. You ask her if she can decipher the scribbles of the TA on your exam, she can't either. Rachelle has Buffy on," but isn't watching it. You sit at your computer and check your e-mail. You have a new """"Ask the Computer Girl"""" from yesterday that you still haven't replied to. You think about changing the name of the subpage in light of recent grades... You visit the guild again. More new messages. The Farscape guild still doesn't though. Nothing new there either. You ask Rachelle what time she wants to eat. She says whenever you want to since her class got cancelled. You decide to do your Calc homework. The Jombone commercial comes on and you remark to Rachelle",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 but in the real world, hello, you get to program on a computer! Rachelle suggests that since you both have to take extra classes that you take a class or two together over the summer at the community college. We shall see... You arrive at the Dining Hall. The girl at the front swipes your card. The place is crowded. The first section is all full," but you find seats in the second section and put your stuff down. You go and get food. They have stir fry tofu today :D yum. You get some of that and """"Hawaiian chicken."""" You go get your water from the funky water thing that likes to come out real slow. It's also a bit pink today since it has a little Hawaiian punch mixed in. Rachelle gets potatoes",,,,,,
 but you decide to walk back instead since it's not too cold out. You come back to the room, still an oven. Rachelle puts on the fan. You start on your Calc homework again. You have concluded that you did not do section 2 at all in class, so you instead decide to work on 9.3. You check your e-mail, someone wants to trade links :D,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you have to go to bed early tonight because Rachelle has to get up early tomorrow. 11 hours of sleep may seem like a lot, but it takes you a good two hours just to fall asleep. Factor in the uncomphyness of the bed and all the noise from the hall and it's only equivalent to about 8 hours or so. You pack your bag with your robe, underwear and towel," grab your basket of shower goodies and head to the bathroom. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/2lifepic9.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You stake claim of your usual stall and put your bag on the floor and you basket on the seat",,,,,,

 but hey, Gregory smith is way cute :D Show's over, but Rachelle says she's not tired yet so you're going to bed at 10:30 instead. You watch the thing on the news about the new movie <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. The Christians liked, gee,,,,,,

Your mom comes in at 6:45 to tell you the dogs were out and fed... you get up. You go say hi to Princess who is laying on your parent's bed. You and your puppies walk to the kitchen and you let them out and put up the gate. You go to the bathroom and brush your teeth. You let the dogs back in. You go downstairs to get clothes to wear. You pick out an oufit and try to find matching socks which takes you a bit too long. You finally prevail. You go to the bathroom and wash your face with a neutrogena facial cleansing cloth. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/lifepic1.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You go and get dressed", brush your hair,,,,,,

You go to English and wish Gloria and happy belated birthday. You're going down to the library to work on your quote projects today. There was a fire drill... now you're back in the building. You're trying to narrow down the quotes you want to use for your project. You need 10, you have over 30, but narrowed it down to 13... not a good number... now you have 12. That works, since that's the # you need. English is over. School is over,,,,,,

10:57am<br />
You wake up. You're a little disoriented after the dream you just had. Something about being a photographer for the mob and crocodiles in the streets/water and leaving your laptop in Andrew's car so you couldn't do a Day in the Life. ...Weird. Bryan gives you a kiss and tells you
he loves you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic1.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic1s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You slept over his house last night. You slept really well too. Nine hours straight. You were really tired after getting only a few hours the night before. Stupid dorm room.
<br />You feel a little sore, so you stretch. What the frell are you sore from, doing laundry? You grab all your little toiletries and head to the bathroom. You brush your teeth, wash your face, put... wait, where are your contacts? You go back into the room to get them, careful not to disturb Bryan who's still sleeping. You put into your contacts and put on your face goop.
<br />You come back and start typing this on his computer in gmail. He wakes up and tells you he loves you. He gets up, looks to see what you're doing and asks, ""did you take a picture while I was sleeping?"" Yes you did!
<br />You check your mail. Your daddy sent you something about a job on Dice, but you don't think you're qualified. You also have one to do a survey for PineCone. Yay, another $5.
<br />Byran says we go eat. He tells you to put on pants so you won't be cold. What?? You wore shorts to bed. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic2.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic2s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You both eat some ""Honey Nut Scooters."" Bryan points out that it's snowing. Something that's been pretty rare this year. He looks through the newspaper. He makes comments about the job postings. He asks you if anyone died from your school while you were going there. You're not sure.
<br />You go back upstairs. Bryan wants to play a game, ""Feeding Frenzy."" He sings a little song, ""You're my Lissy, you're my Lissy, and I love you, and I love you."" You watch him play. You comment that you think Insaniquarium is better. He says, maybe it gets harder, it's just the beginning of the game. He says he loves Lissy. You say that you're not gonna write down every time he says it cause he says it a lot. He gets eaten. He comes over and gives you a kiss. He says he shocked you, you didn't notice anything. You see if there's any good posts over at LifeHacker. Hmm, ""Questions couples wish they'd asked before saying 'I do.'"" Hmm, the link doesn't work. Oh, now it does. Bryan comes back from the bathroom and you show him. Yeah, we've already talked about all that stuff. That and whether we're gonna tell our kid that Santa's real. He asks you where you class is, you say Hardenburg. He says you can walk then. You give him pouty face. He's joking. You put your hair in a ponytail since you don't have a brush. You put your necessities in your laptop case. You hug for a whiles before you leave. You put your hair down again since it looks bad anyways. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic3.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic3s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>

<br /><br />1:06pm

<br />Bryan drops you off in front of your building. You thank him and kiss him goodbye. You're getting to class over 15 minutes later than usual, yet there's still almost no one there yet. Yay for cold weather. You get a seat by the outlet. You put down your lappy, plug it in and get out your homework. People come in. Your teacher comes in 5 minutes late and hands back your journals from last week. This is Philosophy of Psychology by the way. 10/10, ""good points!"" she says. We're talking about Functionalism, again, today because apparently people don't get it. Wtf? You delete the spam from your gmail. You browse facebook. You check the weather, high of 27 today. Supposed to snow a little more later. You start the PineCone survey. Bleh, another one of the stupid shopping trip surveys. You hate those, they take forever to load. Ooooor, maybe it won't load at all. There it goes. Great, now we're talking about parity and making finite state tables and diagrams. Cause you haven't done that to death already. You visit CuteOverload.com, SoapOperaFan.com, ShinyShiny.tv, mySpace. You're hungry. You visit DMB. Class is over, you drop off your homework at the front and head to the bus stop.

<br /><br />2:32pm
<br />You run over to the bus stop to up your body temperature and 'cause you saw a bus coming. Not yours though. You eat your milk and cereal bar while you're waiting. You check the next bus sign, says the H should be here soon. You decide to go to the dining hall before class since you should have enough time and you're still hungry. Usually you eat before your philosophy class. The bus comes, but it's really crowded so you have to stand. 'Least you have something to hold onto this time.
<br />You arrive on Busch. A girl gets off at the first stop and you take her seat. You get off at the student center and walk to the dining hall. They have a weird tent-like thing covering the entrance. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic4.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic4s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You get fajitas and a salad. They have the oreos for the frozen yogurt today which makes you mad because you don't have much time, it's cold out, and you'll be eating chocolate tonight. You get some after you eat anyway though, just a little, cause you have no will power.
<br />You leave the dining hall and walk through the student center stopping at the bathroom. You walk to your next class, Health Psychology, in the Pharmacy Building. You stop in ARC for a second to warm up.

<br /><br />3:16pm
<br /><a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic5.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic5s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at class with a couple minutes to spare. Your usual seat is taken though, so you sit somewhere in the middle. She made a study guide??? Yeesh. And she's going to do a review. What did you study yesterday for? A Jeopardy style review, with dark chocolate as prizes. You don't like dark chocolate. She goes onto the lecture about ethnic and racial disparities in health care. You play Insaniquarium Deluxe which you downloaded yesterday. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic6.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic6s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a> It's stupid question answering time. Every once in a while the professor has you answer a couple of questions and turn in the answer for a point of credit. You pack up your stuff, hand in your answers and grab a few of the leftover chocolates to give to Bryan, though after you realize they'll probably melt before you see him. You leave and head to ARC to meet with your group to discuss your web applications project.

<br /><br />4:30pm
<br />There's a class in the room you're supposed to me in, so you go to the bathroom while you wait and then play Insaniquarium to kill some more time. You go back to the classroom since the class should be ending. The TA that's teaching is the same TA you had for Calc2 freshman year. You take a seat, plug in your lappy and eat one of the chocolates. They're not too bad. You play game again.
<br />Someone in your class arrives. You show him the slides you made. Other people show up. You go over stuffs. They comment on your cute sTabLauncher thing. You decide to go to Serc to look at open source games on the internet. One of the members of your group isn't there yet, so you leave a note on the blackboard.
<br />You arrive in Serc, Carolyn calls you and asks when you're meeting up for the <i>Chocolat</i> thing. You tell her you're with your group and still have to shower. You'll call her when you're done. The other member e-mailed all of you to say you're late. You tell him you moved to Serc. You look through games. One crossword puzzle keeps freezes your computer. You decide on one game, you'll have to look some more for others. One of the group members has to leave for class. You have to leave too.

<br />You call Carolyn on the way back to your room. You tell her to meet you at ARC around 7:15. You rush back to your dorm.

<br /><br />6:40pm
<br />You arrive at your dorm and turn on the hot water since it takes a while to get warm. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic7.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic7s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You plug in your lappy and get you robe and towel and then shower. Ten minutes later you're back in the room. You don't have much time to get ready. You call Carolyn and tell her you're getting dressed and that you should meet at the student center. You get dressed, but it's too hot, so you take off your sweater and sit around in your bra. Eh, the door's locked.
<br />Bryan calls and says he ate and he's gonna take a shower and then pick you up. You put on a t-shirt and go to turn down the thermostat, but it's already at 74. You watch TV while you wait.

<br /><br />7:20pm
<br />Bryan calls and tells you he's on his way. You pack up your stuff, put on your sweater, and go downstairs and wait for him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic8.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic8s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>He gets there a little whiles later. You tell him he's the bestest boyfriend for bringing your bag and going to the chocolate thing with you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic9.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic9s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at the student center and, er, you're the first ones there. You thought it would be more crowded. Hundreds of people came to the Hypnotism thing. You find a seat by an outlet and wait. Bryan loveses you. <-- he wrote that while you went to the bathroom. Carolyn calls you. She says the nextbus thing says the RexB won't come for another 14 minutes. She sees one coming! People start getting chocolate, so you go up and get some. You get seconds as they start the movie, it's very yummy. Carolyn calls a few times, you go fetch her from outside the room. Bryan rubs your back, feel good. Your daddy IMs you and asks if it's snowing yet and if he should pick you up. Your friends laugh because your daddy says,""nite nite :-) dada loves u. did u get momma anything 4 valentines day. i did."" Carolyn wants to go back for seconds, so you get thirds :P Bryan says, ""is that your dinner?"" You nod. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic10.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic10s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>Your hands are now sticky so you go rinse them off. You put some chapstick on. You give Bryan a kiss. Andrew IMs you. He doesn't believe Carolyn's with you. She's proves it by telling him where her butt is. *shrugs*

<br /><br />10:11pm
<br />The movie's over, so you clean up your stuff and leave. You say goodbye to Carolyn and walk with Bryan to his car. On the way there, he tells you he liked the movie. You're glad. You were worried he wouldn't like it 'cause it's kinda a chick flick. You arrive at the car. Unfortunately it iced all over the it and Bryan has to scrape it off. You wait for a while for the car to warm up. This is unfortunate since you have to use the bathroom. Bryan decides it's a good time to give you your valentines day present. He puts his hat over your eyes so you can't see while he takes the tag off. He takes the hat off, it's an adorable mug. You have the cutest boyfriend. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic11.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic11s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>
<br />You go back to your room so you can give him his presies. You give him his chocolate and the presie you made him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic12.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic12s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgFhawKD-U0"" target=""_blank"">See the video.</a>

<br />He looks at your cognitive science book since you two were talking about it last night. He makes a face. You thank each other for being wonderful and for the presies. You hear Amina complain it's so hot even though the heat's so low. You say, ""I know, isn't it!"" You walk Bryan to the door. He turns the heat down, but you put it back up since you think Emily would just do it later anyway. You and Bryan kiss goodbye. You watch him walk down the stairs and wave, then close the door.

<br /><br />10:55pm
<br />You sit at your computer and put on Sex and the City. Carolyn IMs you a little while later. She finally made it back to her dorm. You upload all the pictures you took today. Bryan IMs you ""<3"" Your computer freezes so you have to reboot. You watch Will and Grace. Emily comes back. You check your e-mail. Helen sent out a flier for the WCS meeting Thursday. No one's gonna go to that thing. Emily suddenly shouts ""oh my God! I didn't tell you guys!"" and runs into the other room. You: *shifty eyes* You watch Friends. You edit your life.php file to make it easier to navigate. Emily sneezes, you say, ""bless you."" You can't see the video you uploaded to youtube :( You watch Frasier. You play Insaniquarium again. You take your pills. You're tummy's not very happy about eating chocolate for dinner. 
<br />You go brush your teeth. Emily asks you if you're going out, you tell her you already did. She asks if you're going out tomorrow. You say you're not sure since you have class until late and he has to get up early the next day, though you're gonna try and meet for dinner. You wash your face and put on your face goop. Great, you're getting a new zit. You're nose is a little runny too, you hope you're not getting sick. Your roommates are all sick.
<br />You read a post on ForeverGeek.com about the ""The 10 Greatest Sci-Fi Franchises of All Time"" and Farscape isn't on the list! 'Least Firefly is. You leave a comment. You visit your livejournal friends and comment on Katie's blog. Emily tells you that she's getting roses tomorrow and her ""friend"" is coming over and if he asks, the roses are yours. 

<br /><br />1:40am
<br />You read Chau's blog. You feel sleepy and you're barely concentrating on reading it. You decide to get ready for bed. You take out your contacts and put on your PJs. You wish you were sleeping over Bryan's again. It's so much fun just talking to him. You clean off your bed to make room for sleeping. Your tummy really isn't happy. You go grab a water. You set your alarm for 11:00 since you have an interview at 12 tomorrow for SHI. Hopefully you won't be thinking about it all night and you'll be able to sleep. You put your computer to sleep and them yourself. Night!

<br /><br />7 something? Anyway, way too early
<br/>Your roommate wakes you up. You're awake for a little bit before drifting off to sleep again. You have a dream that your alarm goes off at 11 instead of 8:30 and you miss your first class X( You're not all that upset cause you could miss that class. But you're still relieved to find it was just a dream. You had another dream that you were inside a video game or something with your friends. That was kinda cool. 

<br /><br />8:30am

<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic1.jpg"" align=""left"">Your alarm goes off. No wanna get up! You get up anyway. You notice the toilet paper is once again, not on the roll. For some reason, no one seems to want to put it on anymore besides you. Well, that garbage is getting awfully full. You wonder when it's your turn to clean again. You lost track, you always do. We need a calendar or something. 
<br/>You brushy your teeth, washy your face, put in contacts, all that fun stuff. Gotta put on all your face goop too. You notice the big TV's gone. Pooey. You don't bother making your bed since you'll be washing your sheets when you get back. Makeup today? Nah, not worth it. Yoga? Not on Thursdays, no time, you have class in an hour. You get dressed. Something warm, it's cold out. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic3.jpg"" align=""right"">Brush your hair, put on your shoes, pack up your laptop and head out to the dining hall. You take a quick picture of yourself first. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic2.jpg"" align=""left"">You are almost out the front door when you realize you forgot your philosophy book. You run back upstairs to grab it. You can't find it, you start to panic a little, wait, wait, there it is, under your psych book, heh. You head out to the dining hall again, now a few minutes behind schedule. You walk quickly to make up for the time and because it so cold out. You're awfully tired by the time you get there.
<br/>They never have anything good for breakfast and even if they did, it'd still be bad. You get what looks like it could be an everything bagel and some cream cheese and a glass of milk. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic4.jpg"" align=""right"">You get a seat and take off your gear. You have ten minutes to eat. You pick off pieces of the bagel and dip it in the cream cheese. More efficient eating this way.
<br/>You're done eating and is time to go, so you go outside and wait for an A bus. You know it'll be a little while since you just saw one leave. You put on some chapstick. One comes a couple of minutes later. You walk out quickly, wait for everyone to get off, you're the first one on so you get a seat, whee. You hate standing on the bus. Buses were not made for short people. More like swinging than standing. Aw, a guy stands up so someone else could sit down. You like people like that. People that really bug you are the ones who don't back up so more people can get on the bus, or even worse, when someone takes up more than one seat.
<br/>Ten minutes later, you're on College Ave. You stay on the bus instead of walking because, it's cold out, the bus isn't that crowded and really, it doesn't take much longer and you still have plenty of time. Besides, it's the class after an exam, there won't be too many people there anyway.

<br /><br />9:39
<br/>You arrive at your first class of the day: Intro to Logic, under the dorms. You're not sure why you bother coming since you learned all this stuff back in Discrete I, but it gives you time to read blogs and chat with your friends before your 11:30 class. You were right, not a lot of people here. You feel like having a piece of gum, but you can't find any in your pockets. You take your usual seat in the back by the outlet, plug in your lappy and wake it up. It takes a while, but it does... and then reboots... The thing has a mind of its own. Well, it hasn't been rebooted in a few days. It's done doin' its thing. You start typin'. OK, so you cheated a little. Actually it's 11:03pm the night before and you're typing out some of this ahead of time because you know you don't have much time in the morning. So you fix it up, add in little details. --/end cheat--
<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic5.jpg"" align=""left"">Your professor announces you learn proof today: ""direct proof and indirect proof."" You're still typing, you don't pay much attention, not that you have to. You decide maybe you should take some notes anyway since he tests on definitions. You decide to look for some gum again, you find some this time and have a piece. You have to clean out your flash card so you have room for lotsa pictures today. You decide to connect to the wireless internet too. ""Connected to RUWireless, Signal Strength: Excellent."" You log in. You have a myRutgers Alert? For what??? Oh right, our new RUID's. Ya, they don't wanna use our social security numbers anymore, so we gotta memorize a whole new number. They didn't even assign them yet. Just telling us they will. Like we didn't see the first 15 announcements.
<br/>Your professor's drawing weird lookin' animals on the board. He's so strange. You check your nation, The Spiffy Society of Short Sheep on Nation States. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic6.jpg"" align=""right"">""UN Category: Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Civil Rights: Excellent, Economy: Good, Political Freedoms: Very Good. ... Short Sheep is ranked 10th in the region and 2,249th in the world for Largest Welfare Programs (per capita)."" Your computers flashing a lot of errors at you today... You read peoples' away messages. ""Away,"" ""Bleh"" guess Tom's still in a bad mood, ""Away,"" Emily has a longer one..., ""Away,"" ""Away."" *sigh* You spit out your gum. This class is so boring. Not as boring as Operating Systems though. He's talking about Mormons. o_O Grr, you really gotta learn to stop picking at your lips. Bad Lissy! You still do it even though you yell at yourself. Compulsive much? You put on chapstick. Your professor wants you to answer all the problems in the book. Ya, that'll happen.
<br/>Class is over, you pack up your stuff and leave.

<br /><br />11:10am
<br/>You walk over to your next class two buildings down and make a quick stop in the bathroom before going to your class. Ew, someone left a mess all over the one toilet seat. You wait for the other one. The hand dryer thingy doesn't work either. *sigh* You dry your hands on your pants.
<br/>Your second class of the day: Philosophy of Mind. In the same room number as the other class, just in a different building. Again, you take a seat in the back by the outlet. You'll need your battery power to type when you go visit Carolyn. You sit down and wake up your computer. The guy you went to HS with walks in. He hasn't said anything to you so far this semester. You doubt he even remembers you. You never talked in HS, why start now?

<br/>You log onto the wireless network. Would you stop picking at your lips! Has become such a bad habit now that you don't pick at your nails as much. That calcium you've been taking has made them stronger. Unfortunately you now take your stress out on your poor lips.
<br/>Your professor arrives a few minutes late. You check your site for comments. Oooh, new comments :D You put on your away message saying you're in class. You actually have to pay attention in this one. It's more interesting than your other three too. Also far less work than your writing class last year. Like one teeny reading a week, two papers and two exams. Speaking of which, he's going to pass around suggested topics for the first paper. It's due in two weeks. You add the date to your calendar. You sign the sign in sheet. Students are arguing with the professor about when the midterm's going to be. Right now it's the day after break is over. The class votes to change it to that Thursday instead. Wish that was an option for Data Structures Sophomore year, but your professor didn't schedule that exam, the stupid school did. 
<br/>Going over the Lewis reading today. Didn't we do that last week? Ned Block's the next class? Wasn't that supposed to be today? Wow we go slow. Hey, less reading for you. You take notes.<img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic8.jpg"" align=""right""> Gmail tells you you have a new e-mail from the housing people. No, you don't want to live in Rockoff next year, you already have an apartment. Oops, you missed something, what does that say? Anew or Fade? No... You stare at it for a while. Oh! True or False! Another new e-mail from the creation people telling you there's one more day to order autographed photos. People are debating about Phantom Limbs. You put on your jacket because you're cold. These people are entertaining. Eh, you picked at your finer and now it's bleeding a little. Wow, he's not gonna let you out early today? That's a first. You were just about to IM Carolyn when she IMs you. You tell her he's gonna let you go soon (ya, he lets you out a little early) and you'll be there in like 30/40 minutes or so.
<br/>You walk very quickly to the EE bus stop because it COLD OUT! Not easy to do since it's mostly uphill. But get there just as a bus is pulling up. You wait until the loaded bus almost completely empties and finally you get on and take a seat. Nice and warm :D A couple minutes later, the bus leaves for Douglass.

<br /><br />1:07pm
<br/>You arrive at the bus stop by the dining hall and call Carolyn to let her know you're here. You wait for her inside for a second. She tells you she's getting sick. Uh ohs. You get some sort of chicken, tofu and fried rice plus a salad :P You sit with Carolyn's friends. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic9.jpg"" align=""left"">They mostly talk about music stuff. You finish eating and start type as Carolyn chats with Pedro. You suggest getting frozen yogert. You do. Yummy strawberry with oreos! Frozen yogurt goooood. 
<br/>After eating and chatting, you walk over to Carolyn's dorm. You say you dunno if you wanna sit on the germ infested bed. You do anyway. You'll probably catch her cold regardless. You like her bed. It much higher than yours. That cool. You talk about the new RUID numbers. Carolyn's like, how we supposed to memorize this? You say the same way you memorized your social security number. She tries to convince you it's not the same. She visits cuteoverload.com. You log onto RUWireless. You comment that it says the signal's very good today, usually it says it pretty bad. You say maybe it depends on where you are in the room since you're about a foot away from where you usually sit. You test to see if there's a lag now that you both have Trillian, there is. You chat back and forth online, lol. You check your site comments. New one from Mere. He he, ""Hooray for finding a home! Although, boxes can be nice too. =)"" You start reading this to Carolyn and get to the part about your book. You think... hey, where is your book. You look around you. Uh oh. You and Carolyn go back to the dining hall to get it. That damn book causes more trouble! We didn't even use it today! From now on you're scanning the readings in.
<br/>You ask the lady if anyone found a Philosophy book. She says yesterday, but no, this was today. She lets you go look for it. You find it on the table where you left it surrounded by confused peoples. You walk back to Carolyn's dorm. You ask her if she wants to watch the end of Passions. She puts it on for you :) Grr, stupid spam IMs! You watch some weird flash animation. You watch the silly Harry Potter animation. You get an e-mail: Tutor's Wanted. Great grammar there. You wonder if that's something you should think about doing.

<br /><br />3:00pm
<br/>Time to go. You got laundry and homework to do. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic11.jpg"" align=""left"">Carolyn walks you outside and you see the F bus. You try to run and catch it, but no, too late. Oh well. Carolyn waits with you until an EE comes. Should you get off at the last stop and wait for a REXB or take the EE to College Ave and wait for an A or an H. You decide, since it's not too cold, waiting for an REXB is the better choice since it's faster... most of the time. And that bus stop is the warmest one out of all of them. The sun hits it just right or something. Always like 10 degrees warmer there. So you get off and you wait. And you wait, and you wait. You see several REXBs and Ls pass by in the other direction. Finally, after almost 30 minutes, one finally comes down your way. You notice your daddy called at some point so you listen to his message and call him back to tell him yes, you are taking the train back with Carolyn tomorrow and no, you do not have off until spring vacation X( 
<br/>You take the bus back to Busch and get off at the Serc stop since it doesn't go by the dorms. You walk back. Finally, 3:45 you make it back to your dorm. You ask your suitemates if they know whose week it is to clean. No one seems to have any idea. That makes you feel a bit better. And you didn't particularly want to clean the toilet anyway.
<br/<!--more-->>But you do have to do your laundry. You separate your clothes: Stuff that needs to be washed today, other stuff that doesn't so much. You go to the machines. Someone has stuff in the dryer, but the wash is free, so you put your stuff in. It'll be done at 4:35. You go back to your room and hook up your computer. Cynthia comes in (that's your roommate by the way) and you tell her that no one seems to know whose week it is to clean. She said she just saw Deyo cleaning this morning. But, you just asked her. OK, whatever, we clean next week. You should do your homework, or at least scan in those readings so you don't have to worry about your stupid book anymore. You do that. Well that was more trouble than it's worth. 

<br /><br />4:35pm

<br />You go take your stuff out of the wash, put it in the dryer and put your next load in. They'll be done at 5:20. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic14.jpg"" align=""right"">You look at your copies, they look pretty bad. Why couldn't they have an online book. Bleh. You go put two bottles of water in the fridge so Adi doesn't have to drink warm water again.
<br />You're sleepy all of a sudden. How you supposed to do homework when you're sleepy? You don't wanna do your programming assignment! You check out Shiny Shiny. Wow, a <a href=""http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2006/02/icool_smelly_mp.html"" target=""_blank"">Scented MP3 Player</a>. You go to your mySpace to listen to Banana Phone which Krissy dared you to put on your profile yesterday. You go read friends' LJs. Your LJ isn't pretty anymore since they disabled your layout for some reason. Something about security? They did it to a bunch of people. Ya know, maybe if we didn't have to use the stupid overrides and could just use normal CSS code like the rest of the universe, there wouldn't be a problem! You go check out deviantArt. No one's uploaded anything new... Well you can't start your homework now. You gotta go get your laundry in a few minutes. You check what the dining hall's gonna have for dinner. You see there's a speed dating thing on College Ave tonight. Hmm, naw. You already refused to go to Douglass to make chocolate with Carolyn, she'd kill you if you went to that instead. Besides, Adi's coming over for Farscape. They have another one the 28th. Well that's after Valentines Day, that kinda defeats the purpose, lol. 

<br /><br />5:20pm
<br />You go and fetch your clothes. There's a guy there waiting to do his laundry and is probably quite relieved to see you. Lotsa people doin' their laundry today. He says he likes your slippers. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic15.jpg"" align=""left"">:P You take your clothes out of the dryer and put your next load in. 6:00 you gotta check again. You decide maybe you should start the programming assignment. You write it out on paper first. You think better on paper. The other day, the TA told you to do it a different way from what your professor said, so you gotta look up the function he told you to use in your notes. Hmm... you better look some stuff up. This fork stuff is every so slightly more complicated than the I/O stuff and since you don't exactly pay attention during lecture, you're not 100% sure what you're doing, but the site you look up makes things a bit clearer. Now you just gotta program it. You go to fetch your laundry first.<img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic16.jpg"" align=""right"">

<br /><br />6:00pm
<br />You decide to take a shower",,,,,,,
 it's every time you copy something that you get an error from the google bar dictionary thing. It's 7:05," you're supposed to call Adi and leave him a message to remind him to come over since he can't remember on his own. You do. You put your phone on ring so you'll actually know when he calls and not make him sit in his car for 20 minutes before you realize you're a ditz. You only did it once... <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic17.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">Almost done writing your program. This really is easy. Not that you're complaining or anything. Nothing wrong with easy. You don't feel like running it right now. You'll wait until like Monday or Tuesday for that. Yeah... Though that leaves you with nothing to do... You can uh... comb your hair! Anything to keep from doing homework.",,,,,,,,
 that reminds you, you never looked up the dinner menu even though you said you were going to... anyway, he says we can have popcorn. You explain that popcorn isn't dinner and that you could lend him money. He says no. Pfft. Whatever, your hair isn't even dry yet and you're in ur PJ bottoms,,,,,,
 you were going to go check when your advisor has office hours tomorrow. Since you're gonna be here on a Friday morning, may as well go. You dunno if you should bother. They're pretty clear about requirements and you're pretty sure you've completed them all, well, except the number of credits. And they don't help with major/minor requirements anyway. Though she may know some easy classes you can take next semester as fillers...,,,,,,

" you're a little cold without your robe so you put on a sweatshirt. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic19.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You check the dinner menu. Nothing really good. Chicken parm", eh. You decide to pack a little while you wait. Well that didn't take very long. You don't have a whole lot to bring home with you as you left a lot of samples of your face goop and stuff there. Just gotta pack your Seasonale and you'll be done.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
" it's been about 40 minutes since he called... Two minutes later the phone rings. Gah! It makes you jump! lol. Adi's here. You go and fetch Adi and tell him about your a Day in the Life of Lissy. And that the big TV is missing. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic20.jpg"""" align=""""right"""">He tells you he's not going to read all this", he's just gonna scroll down to the part about him. Eh, probably only your mommy will read the whole thing. Hi mommy. You plug in the DVD player to watch Farscape, on the little TV. You bring your laptop in too and put on the first episode of season 3.,,,,,,
 sad ending, Zahn :( Ep's over. You put in the popcorn and take the water out of the fridge. Adi asks if you'd want to do a website if he got another artist for another comic, you say ya. He asks how will we know when the popcorn's done, you say when it's done or two seconds between pops. It beeps,,,,,,
 but hey, it's Farscape. A bad episode of Farscape is better than a good episode of any other show. Episode is kinda depressing though. Adi makes a bad joke about Virginia's makeup and her bad reaction to it cause her character isn't doin' so good. Some of your suitemates walk by and say hi. Cynthia asks Adi about his motorcycle. ,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 that's right Abby's pregnant. You really gotta watch this show more often. Uh oh, someone gonna get killed. Oh poo, commercial's almost over and you forgot to go to the bathroom cause you were so busy editing this. Oh well," can wait for the next one. Poor Neela.

He not so good at the multitasking :P You read a little of your previous days and notice you watched Farscape a few years ago too. You IM Adi to tell him this amazing piece of information. He's shocked. You roommate puts on Sex and the City. How could you have forgotten about Sex and the City??? Greg says he's going to bed, you shoulda messaged earlier. But you was watchin' the Farscape. Aw, you wrote about your puppies too :( You miss your puppies. Usually you're home with them by now. Oh,,,,,,

 Economy: thriving, Political Freedoms: world benchmark. Not bad :) First in the region for Largest Trout Farming Sector too. Cool. You were number one yesterday for best weather as well. Yes, still, no life. You have one outstanding issue that you take care of. You dismiss it.,,,,,,
 you lost... You try again. You got one again. This game sucks. You play one more time and then you'll give up. One yet again. OK, that's enough np wasted. You spin the Wheel of Excitement to try and win some of those np back, but you just loose some more. Ah well, you'll play a game later. You've run out of sites to visit. You decide to watch TV and play Mynci Volleyball since it's 2x the neopoints today. Aw,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 put on your jacket and watch the last few minutes of Sliders. After it's over you quickly rush out the door since you now have only 12 minutes to get to class. You walk more swiftly than usual and arrive at class with 5 minutes to spare. You sit in your usual spot, two rows up and two seats in. You take out your Jornada. The kid sitting by you asks if it does wireless, you sadly reply, no. Two minutes left. Some dude walks in the classroom who isn't the professor and starts erasing the board... sub? You have something in your eye. Beh,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 so you chew on a piece of sugar free spearmint gum. You finished the second chapter of the book and cross that reading off of your list of readings to do. You play solitaire while you wait for class to start. Your TA arrives and you all hand in your homework. You take out a pencil. Class begins. He goes over the homework. You picked the broken pencil again, you take out another one. You doodle. You run out of doodle room again, so you play solitaire. One card from winning. Frell. Oh well. You start a new game. Lost again. You keep playing. You messed up your homework a little, oops. Looks like you're not the only one. Hey,,,,,,

 two cars decided to park very close to each other. You walk around one of the cars instead, carefully so you don't slip on the ice. Someone is coming out of the dorm as you and a few other people arrive. You don't have to swipe your card again :) The construction peoples and their equipment are gone too. You walk upstairs and to your dorm which is unlocked again. You don't hear anyone, but there's probably someone here.,,,,,,,

 you just saw this episode. You check TVGuide.com to see what else is on. Hmm, Will and Grace, Charmed or Seinfeld. You decide to see which episode of Charmed it is. Eh," bad one.

 thatâs next month too. Cory asks if he can call you later. You remind him youâre writing every detail of your life today down. Also that Gilmore Girls is on at 8 and you have to take a shower before then. He asks if he can call after, but Sex in the City is on ? He doesnât know if his dad will let him call. You check your mail again. Your daddy e-mailed you back about transferring your site. He said we can do Friday. And he also said your database book came! Yay! You tell Cory he can call during Sex in the City. You usually never really watch it anyway since youâre always doing something on the computer. Plus, youâd rather talk to him today than tomorrow since you have the quiz to study for. He goes to ask his dad. You IM Greg a silly emoticon. Coryâs daddy said he can call, lol. He says youâre hard to negotiate with. Well,,,,,,

 you get out of the shower, dry off and head back to your room. You go back on the computer and take off your away message. Hmm, Word isnât behaving, grr. You chat with Greg and Cory some more while waiting for Gilmore Girls to start. Youâre craving Fudge Oreos,,,,,,
 lol. You put them in and poor yourself some water and take it back to the room. Now thereâs a commercial. On your way back to the Oreos your roommateâs friend passes by and you wave. You take the Oreos back to your room. Oh they look so good. Oh they taste so good. Soooo good. Coryâs nervous about talking to you. Ya, youâre way scary. ,,,,,,,,

Pfft. âA personal blog that probably won't be of much interest outside of friends and immediate family.â Obviously they never met Cory. You complain to Greg about them.

 channel 51 and turn it to face you so you can play on Neopets while you watch. You visit your guild (www.avatar.com) on your sn imLissy that you just made a new layout for yesterday. You're not the leader of the guild, but you do have a comphy council position. Yes, you still don't have a life... On your other account yesterday," you were finally able to score some Tiki Armour for the Pant Devil Taunt av. You shall refresh a lot in a few minutes to try and get it.

 the ARC bathroom, where the evil automatic toilets live that either flush while you're still on them or don't bother to flush at all. Unfortunately, you pick the first kind today, eep. You then leave and walk to your classroom where in about 20 minutes or so,,,,,,

 you don't have lab tomorrow because of your exam Thursday, so you have extra time to do it. Tonight you can either study for Physics or do Calc homework. Hmm... which is the lesser of two evils? 10 minutes left. You're very bored. You would doodle, but you use your Jornada to type notes for this class and not so much fun doodling with a stylus. You check how much battery power you have left. 9/10," perty good. You decide you can listen to some music. You have some songs from your Walt Disney World soundtrack and the <i>Wicked</i> soundtrack on your flash card. You detach your headphones from your MP3 player and plug them in. You open up Windows Media Player and listen to """"Dancing Though Life"""" from <i>Wicked</i>. Your professor comes in",,,,,,

You have a new """"Ask the Computer Girl"""" from yesterday that you still haven't replied to. You think about changing the name of the subpage in light of recent grades... You visit the guild again. More new messages. The Farscape guild still doesn't though. Nothing new there either. You ask Rachelle what time she wants to eat. She says whenever you want to since her class got cancelled. You decide to do your Calc homework. The Jombone commercial comes on and you remark to Rachelle",,,,,,

 but in the real world, hello, you get to program on a computer! Rachelle suggests that since you both have to take extra classes that you take a class or two together over the summer at the community college. We shall see... You arrive at the Dining Hall. The girl at the front swipes your card. The place is crowded. The first section is all full," but you find seats in the second section and put your stuff down. You go and get food. They have stir fry tofu today :D yum. You get some of that and """"Hawaiian chicken."""" You go get your water from the funky water thing that likes to come out real slow. It's also a bit pink today since it has a little Hawaiian punch mixed in. Rachelle gets potatoes",,,,,,
 but you decide to walk back instead since it's not too cold out. You come back to the room, still an oven. Rachelle puts on the fan. You start on your Calc homework again. You have concluded that you did not do section 2 at all in class, so you instead decide to work on 9.3. You check your e-mail, someone wants to trade links :D,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you have to go to bed early tonight because Rachelle has to get up early tomorrow. 11 hours of sleep may seem like a lot, but it takes you a good two hours just to fall asleep. Factor in the uncomphyness of the bed and all the noise from the hall and it's only equivalent to about 8 hours or so. You pack your bag with your robe, underwear and towel," grab your basket of shower goodies and head to the bathroom. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/2lifepic9.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You stake claim of your usual stall and put your bag on the floor and you basket on the seat",,,,,,

You and your puppies walk to the kitchen and you let them out and put up the gate. You go to the bathroom and brush your teeth. You let the dogs back in. You go downstairs to get clothes to wear.

You're going to have a homework quiz, so you take out your sheet and look over it. Your teacher passes out the papers and you take the quiz. After you're done,,,,,,
 you say yes. You do warm-ups. Your teacher tells everyone they have to do ten pushups, you only do nine. You go down to the weightroom and go on the exercise bike, the seat's too high. You try to fix it, but you can't figure out how. You get back on the bike. One of the gym teachers walk by and asks how you are,,,,,,
 she's at a computer. You sign in. You find out now that you have to sign up to use a computer, how stupid is that.,,,,,,,,
 you both laugh. What the heck was that? LOL. You type some more. Merry asks you what you're doing so you tell her your doing another in the Life of Lissy thing. You type some more. Merry says she can't spell and asks you if you can spell social. You say, S-O-C-I-A-L...merry thought you said A-I-L... der, no, anyway... she then asks how you spell opertunities. Youre not sure,,,,,,
" """"something bad I hope."""" and merry says no and he says"," """"probably acurate anyway."""" he's funny. We talk about our teachers and our language finals. The bell rings", we get up to go into the class, but the door's locked. The teacher comes and unlocks the door. We walk in and you put her backpack down. You leave and go to the bathroom, you are close, he he. OK,what to do with the next three minutes... the school's clock is so slow.Your clock on your jornada (the correct time) says it's 10:55, the school's clock says it's 10:52. Bell just rang.. you walk to your locker. You put away your trapper, you math book and your bottle of water. You walk to Latin. Oops, you forgot your book. You won't need it anyway. You sit in Latin and type. He gives you something to translate. You translate it.
,,,,,,,,,
 ew little more than half. You hope you have enough for the rest of the day. That sheet was really easy. He gave you a midterm review sheet.You look over it and put the stuff you didn't have in your notes in your notes. You are very bored. You don'treally wanna play a game cause your woried about your battery life... what the heck... you play backgamon. You have the tiny toon theme song stuck in your heck, erg. You were loosing backgamon so you quit. The bell will ring soon. 90% of the class leaves before the bell rings, but you're always early for pre-calc, so you wait. You go to your locker and get your trapper and you math book. You go to pre-calc. You talk to Merry about latin and you sit down. LOL,,,,,,
 but there's a fire drill at the end of the period, so you go outside, come in, and go to American History. The door's locked. Rachelle passes by,,,,,,
 but to meet guys too. You also talk about the trip to disney world both of you will be taking this spring. Rachelle's mom comes. She gives you a ride home because your dad's still in Connectecut learning stuff. On the way home you discuss spiders and how evil they are. When you reach your house, you gatherup your belongings, get out of the car and go inside. You take down the gate for Buffy and the chairs for Princess. You let them out, get the mail,,,,,,
 say the opening with Quinn, close the unnecessary windows and plug your jornada in. You decide to go to the JUB. You hope the site actually loads this time. Nope, da JUB still doesn't work. You go to neopets instead. You check for new stuff and the procede to the rainbow skyz guild. Wait, you decide to enter the caption contest first. Now you go to your guild. Plug: The Rainbow Skyz Guild,,,,,,
 take out your contacts. Press record because you're recording ER and go to sleep or atleast try until the scene with Cater comes on and you just have to watch it cause he's so cute. Then you turn off the TV and go to sleep.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 then you let Buffy and Princess out. You fed them. You went back to your room, put on your Mickey Mouse shirt, tan pants, yellow sweat shirt and yellow socks and your sneakers. You wipe your face with Biore face wipe and are about to wash off that icky stuff it leaves on your fancy,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 but at least you didn't repeat the second verse... You allow yourself to eat the tootsie roll pop you've been carrying around as a reward. Cherry... very yummy! Your throat that hurt a little feels better now.<br />,,,,,,,,,
 she said you could try out for the solo again today (as it turns out Erin and Devon got the solos again, arg). <br />,,,,,,,,
 so you leave them in there.<br />,,,,,,,,,
 you are the group's bank. You go and buy your lunch. Icky pizza, fries or a chocolate chip muffin... muffin. You also buy some yoo-hoo for a change. You never drink soda. Water usually. You return to your seat... Jackie's still absent (<i>with mono</i>) and Rachelle's not in school either. Darn. You talk to Anastasia a bit, eat your lunch, drink your yoo-hoo and write in your journal for your webpage (<i>this</i>). God knows you have nothing better to do. You draw a smiley face on your nail with your purple pen. You're very tired... Anastasia gives you a watermelon sour patch kid. Oh,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 so you're using purple instead. OK, you got a lot right that you guessed on. You're convinced you're psychic. OK, maybe not... Algebra's almost over... you discuss the SATs and PSATs with Susan and Angela is still taking her make-up test. You have a 92 average in this class. Not too bad.<br />,,,,,,,
 nice of your teacher to not tell you that your homework wasn't due 'till tomorrow... Just an average day at Liver Dull High School. You took a quiz. You got 3 wrong. You made a dumb mistake. You go to English and wish Gloria and happy belated birthday. You're going down to the library to work on your quote projects today. There was a fire drill... now you're back in the building. You're trying to narrow down the quotes you want to use for your project. You need 10, you have over 30, but narrowed it down to 13... not a good number... now you have 12. That works, since that's the # you need. English is over. School is over,,,,,,
 so you better go sign in... The lights aren't the way they're supposed to be so Ms. Smith is messing with them. Before during DE, Erin said that next years schedule might be 4 periods that are like 80 minutes each... You would kill yourself. It's like 3:02 now... You sing warm-ups along with the rest of the chorus of course. You had gone to your locker before class started because no one was here yet. You got your jacket," hat and AH book and Spanish book. Right now you're holding Lucky Alien Dude still from DE. You're writing and singing at the same time! He he... sing scales... Do Re Me Fa So La Ti Do... Now you're going to sing """"I've Got Shoes."""" Now you sing """"Since First I Saw Your Face."""" Ms. Smith announced Thursday you meet in the Auditorium (you're in the Little Theater now) 3 soloists aren't it"," it was funny :) The vice principal comes in and asks about rows. You showed Angela what you wrote about her. You're missing a crescendo. Next you sing """"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."""" Now the guys leave and the girls sing """"Carol of the Bells."""" You will leave now",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you order a plain whopper with cheese and onion rings. You come home, put down your stuff, greet Buffy, take down the gate,,,,,,
" so the puppies ran in your room. Princess is sittin with you and watchin TV and lookin for something to eat. You yell at her a wittle cause she's eatin stuff she shouldn't be. """"Don't Eat That Tissue!"""" You let the puppies out", bush your teeth... wait, you did that when you put your retainer in... brush your hair, put on your purple PJs,,,,,,

10:57am<br />
You wake up. You're a little disoriented after the dream you just had. Something about being a photographer for the mob and crocodiles in the streets/water and leaving your laptop in Andrew's car so you couldn't do a Day in the Life. ...Weird. Bryan gives you a kiss and tells you
he loves you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic1.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic1s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You slept over his house last night. You slept really well too. Nine hours straight. You were really tired after getting only a few hours the night before. Stupid dorm room.
<br />You feel a little sore, so you stretch. What the frell are you sore from, doing laundry? You grab all your little toiletries and head to the bathroom. You brush your teeth, wash your face, put... wait, where are your contacts? You go back into the room to get them, careful not to disturb Bryan who's still sleeping. You put into your contacts and put on your face goop.
<br />You come back and start typing this on his computer in gmail. He wakes up and tells you he loves you. He gets up, looks to see what you're doing and asks, ""did you take a picture while I was sleeping?"" Yes you did!
<br />You check your mail. Your daddy sent you something about a job on Dice, but you don't think you're qualified. You also have one to do a survey for PineCone. Yay, another $5.
<br />Byran says we go eat. He tells you to put on pants so you won't be cold. What?? You wore shorts to bed. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic2.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic2s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You both eat some ""Honey Nut Scooters."" Bryan points out that it's snowing. Something that's been pretty rare this year. He looks through the newspaper. He makes comments about the job postings. He asks you if anyone died from your school while you were going there. You're not sure.
<br />You go back upstairs. Bryan wants to play a game, ""Feeding Frenzy."" He sings a little song, ""You're my Lissy, you're my Lissy, and I love you, and I love you."" You watch him play. You comment that you think Insaniquarium is better. He says, maybe it gets harder, it's just the beginning of the game. He says he loves Lissy. You say that you're not gonna write down every time he says it cause he says it a lot. He gets eaten. He comes over and gives you a kiss. He says he shocked you, you didn't notice anything. You see if there's any good posts over at LifeHacker. Hmm, ""Questions couples wish they'd asked before saying 'I do.'"" Hmm, the link doesn't work. Oh, now it does. Bryan comes back from the bathroom and you show him. Yeah, we've already talked about all that stuff. That and whether we're gonna tell our kid that Santa's real. He asks you where you class is, you say Hardenburg. He says you can walk then. You give him pouty face. He's joking. You put your hair in a ponytail since you don't have a brush. You put your necessities in your laptop case. You hug for a whiles before you leave. You put your hair down again since it looks bad anyways. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic3.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic3s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>

<br /><br />1:06pm

<br />Bryan drops you off in front of your building. You thank him and kiss him goodbye. You're getting to class over 15 minutes later than usual, yet there's still almost no one there yet. Yay for cold weather. You get a seat by the outlet. You put down your lappy, plug it in and get out your homework. People come in. Your teacher comes in 5 minutes late and hands back your journals from last week. This is Philosophy of Psychology by the way. 10/10, ""good points!"" she says. We're talking about Functionalism, again, today because apparently people don't get it. Wtf? You delete the spam from your gmail. You browse facebook. You check the weather, high of 27 today. Supposed to snow a little more later. You start the PineCone survey. Bleh, another one of the stupid shopping trip surveys. You hate those, they take forever to load. Ooooor, maybe it won't load at all. There it goes. Great, now we're talking about parity and making finite state tables and diagrams. Cause you haven't done that to death already. You visit CuteOverload.com, SoapOperaFan.com, ShinyShiny.tv, mySpace. You're hungry. You visit DMB. Class is over, you drop off your homework at the front and head to the bus stop.

<br /><br />2:32pm
<br />You run over to the bus stop to up your body temperature and 'cause you saw a bus coming. Not yours though. You eat your milk and cereal bar while you're waiting. You check the next bus sign, says the H should be here soon. You decide to go to the dining hall before class since you should have enough time and you're still hungry. Usually you eat before your philosophy class. The bus comes, but it's really crowded so you have to stand. 'Least you have something to hold onto this time.
<br />You arrive on Busch. A girl gets off at the first stop and you take her seat. You get off at the student center and walk to the dining hall. They have a weird tent-like thing covering the entrance. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic4.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic4s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>You get fajitas and a salad. They have the oreos for the frozen yogurt today which makes you mad because you don't have much time, it's cold out, and you'll be eating chocolate tonight. You get some after you eat anyway though, just a little, cause you have no will power.
<br />You leave the dining hall and walk through the student center stopping at the bathroom. You walk to your next class, Health Psychology, in the Pharmacy Building. You stop in ARC for a second to warm up.

<br /><br />3:16pm
<br /><a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic5.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic5s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at class with a couple minutes to spare. Your usual seat is taken though, so you sit somewhere in the middle. She made a study guide??? Yeesh. And she's going to do a review. What did you study yesterday for? A Jeopardy style review, with dark chocolate as prizes. You don't like dark chocolate. She goes onto the lecture about ethnic and racial disparities in health care. You play Insaniquarium Deluxe which you downloaded yesterday. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic6.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic6s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a> It's stupid question answering time. Every once in a while the professor has you answer a couple of questions and turn in the answer for a point of credit. You pack up your stuff, hand in your answers and grab a few of the leftover chocolates to give to Bryan, though after you realize they'll probably melt before you see him. You leave and head to ARC to meet with your group to discuss your web applications project.

<br /><br />4:30pm
<br />There's a class in the room you're supposed to me in, so you go to the bathroom while you wait and then play Insaniquarium to kill some more time. You go back to the classroom since the class should be ending. The TA that's teaching is the same TA you had for Calc2 freshman year. You take a seat, plug in your lappy and eat one of the chocolates. They're not too bad. You play game again.
<br />Someone in your class arrives. You show him the slides you made. Other people show up. You go over stuffs. They comment on your cute sTabLauncher thing. You decide to go to Serc to look at open source games on the internet. One of the members of your group isn't there yet, so you leave a note on the blackboard.
<br />You arrive in Serc, Carolyn calls you and asks when you're meeting up for the <i>Chocolat</i> thing. You tell her you're with your group and still have to shower. You'll call her when you're done. The other member e-mailed all of you to say you're late. You tell him you moved to Serc. You look through games. One crossword puzzle keeps freezes your computer. You decide on one game, you'll have to look some more for others. One of the group members has to leave for class. You have to leave too.

<br />You call Carolyn on the way back to your room. You tell her to meet you at ARC around 7:15. You rush back to your dorm.

<br /><br />6:40pm
<br />You arrive at your dorm and turn on the hot water since it takes a while to get warm. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic7.jpg"" target=""_blank""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic7s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You plug in your lappy and get you robe and towel and then shower. Ten minutes later you're back in the room. You don't have much time to get ready. You call Carolyn and tell her you're getting dressed and that you should meet at the student center. You get dressed, but it's too hot, so you take off your sweater and sit around in your bra. Eh, the door's locked.
<br />Bryan calls and says he ate and he's gonna take a shower and then pick you up. You put on a t-shirt and go to turn down the thermostat, but it's already at 74. You watch TV while you wait.

<br /><br />7:20pm
<br />Bryan calls and tells you he's on his way. You pack up your stuff, put on your sweater, and go downstairs and wait for him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic8.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic8s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>He gets there a little whiles later. You tell him he's the bestest boyfriend for bringing your bag and going to the chocolate thing with you. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic9.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic9s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>You arrive at the student center and, er, you're the first ones there. You thought it would be more crowded. Hundreds of people came to the Hypnotism thing. You find a seat by an outlet and wait. Bryan loveses you. <-- he wrote that while you went to the bathroom. Carolyn calls you. She says the nextbus thing says the RexB won't come for another 14 minutes. She sees one coming! People start getting chocolate, so you go up and get some. You get seconds as they start the movie, it's very yummy. Carolyn calls a few times, you go fetch her from outside the room. Bryan rubs your back, feel good. Your daddy IMs you and asks if it's snowing yet and if he should pick you up. Your friends laugh because your daddy says,""nite nite :-) dada loves u. did u get momma anything 4 valentines day. i did."" Carolyn wants to go back for seconds, so you get thirds :P Bryan says, ""is that your dinner?"" You nod. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic10.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic10s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>Your hands are now sticky so you go rinse them off. You put some chapstick on. You give Bryan a kiss. Andrew IMs you. He doesn't believe Carolyn's with you. She's proves it by telling him where her butt is. *shrugs*

<br /><br />10:11pm
<br />The movie's over, so you clean up your stuff and leave. You say goodbye to Carolyn and walk with Bryan to his car. On the way there, he tells you he liked the movie. You're glad. You were worried he wouldn't like it 'cause it's kinda a chick flick. You arrive at the car. Unfortunately it iced all over the it and Bryan has to scrape it off. You wait for a while for the car to warm up. This is unfortunate since you have to use the bathroom. Bryan decides it's a good time to give you your valentines day present. He puts his hat over your eyes so you can't see while he takes the tag off. He takes the hat off, it's an adorable mug. You have the cutest boyfriend. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic11.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic11s.jpg"" align=""right"" border=""0""></a>
<br />You go back to your room so you can give him his presies. You give him his chocolate and the presie you made him. <a href=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/5lifepic12.jpg""><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/thumbs/5lifepic12s.jpg"" align=""left"" border=""0""></a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgFhawKD-U0"" target=""_blank"">See the video.</a>

<br />He looks at your cognitive science book since you two were talking about it last night. He makes a face. You thank each other for being wonderful and for the presies. You hear Amina complain it's so hot even though the heat's so low. You say, ""I know, isn't it!"" You walk Bryan to the door. He turns the heat down, but you put it back up since you think Emily would just do it later anyway. You and Bryan kiss goodbye. You watch him walk down the stairs and wave, then close the door.

<br /><br />10:55pm
<br />You sit at your computer and put on Sex and the City. Carolyn IMs you a little while later. She finally made it back to her dorm. You upload all the pictures you took today. Bryan IMs you ""<3"" Your computer freezes so you have to reboot. You watch Will and Grace. Emily comes back. You check your e-mail. Helen sent out a flier for the WCS meeting Thursday. No one's gonna go to that thing. Emily suddenly shouts ""oh my God! I didn't tell you guys!"" and runs into the other room. You: *shifty eyes* You watch Friends. You edit your life.php file to make it easier to navigate. Emily sneezes, you say, ""bless you."" You can't see the video you uploaded to youtube :( You watch Frasier. You play Insaniquarium again. You take your pills. You're tummy's not very happy about eating chocolate for dinner. 
<br />You go brush your teeth. Emily asks you if you're going out, you tell her you already did. She asks if you're going out tomorrow. You say you're not sure since you have class until late and he has to get up early the next day, though you're gonna try and meet for dinner. You wash your face and put on your face goop. Great, you're getting a new zit. You're nose is a little runny too, you hope you're not getting sick. Your roommates are all sick.
<br />You read a post on ForeverGeek.com about the ""The 10 Greatest Sci-Fi Franchises of All Time"" and Farscape isn't on the list! 'Least Firefly is. You leave a comment. You visit your livejournal friends and comment on Katie's blog. Emily tells you that she's getting roses tomorrow and her ""friend"" is coming over and if he asks, the roses are yours. 

<br /><br />1:40am
<br />You read Chau's blog. You feel sleepy and you're barely concentrating on reading it. You decide to get ready for bed. You take out your contacts and put on your PJs. You wish you were sleeping over Bryan's again. It's so much fun just talking to him. You clean off your bed to make room for sleeping. Your tummy really isn't happy. You go grab a water. You set your alarm for 11:00 since you have an interview at 12 tomorrow for SHI. Hopefully you won't be thinking about it all night and you'll be able to sleep. You put your computer to sleep and them yourself. Night!

<br /><br />7 something? Anyway, way too early
<br/>Your roommate wakes you up. You're awake for a little bit before drifting off to sleep again. You have a dream that your alarm goes off at 11 instead of 8:30 and you miss your first class X( You're not all that upset cause you could miss that class. But you're still relieved to find it was just a dream. You had another dream that you were inside a video game or something with your friends. That was kinda cool. 

<br /><br />8:30am

<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic1.jpg"" align=""left"">Your alarm goes off. No wanna get up! You get up anyway. You notice the toilet paper is once again, not on the roll. For some reason, no one seems to want to put it on anymore besides you. Well, that garbage is getting awfully full. You wonder when it's your turn to clean again. You lost track, you always do. We need a calendar or something. 
<br/>You brushy your teeth, washy your face, put in contacts, all that fun stuff. Gotta put on all your face goop too. You notice the big TV's gone. Pooey. You don't bother making your bed since you'll be washing your sheets when you get back. Makeup today? Nah, not worth it. Yoga? Not on Thursdays, no time, you have class in an hour. You get dressed. Something warm, it's cold out. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic3.jpg"" align=""right"">Brush your hair, put on your shoes, pack up your laptop and head out to the dining hall. You take a quick picture of yourself first. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic2.jpg"" align=""left"">You are almost out the front door when you realize you forgot your philosophy book. You run back upstairs to grab it. You can't find it, you start to panic a little, wait, wait, there it is, under your psych book, heh. You head out to the dining hall again, now a few minutes behind schedule. You walk quickly to make up for the time and because it so cold out. You're awfully tired by the time you get there.
<br/>They never have anything good for breakfast and even if they did, it'd still be bad. You get what looks like it could be an everything bagel and some cream cheese and a glass of milk. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic4.jpg"" align=""right"">You get a seat and take off your gear. You have ten minutes to eat. You pick off pieces of the bagel and dip it in the cream cheese. More efficient eating this way.
<br/>You're done eating and is time to go, so you go outside and wait for an A bus. You know it'll be a little while since you just saw one leave. You put on some chapstick. One comes a couple of minutes later. You walk out quickly, wait for everyone to get off, you're the first one on so you get a seat, whee. You hate standing on the bus. Buses were not made for short people. More like swinging than standing. Aw, a guy stands up so someone else could sit down. You like people like that. People that really bug you are the ones who don't back up so more people can get on the bus, or even worse, when someone takes up more than one seat.
<br/>Ten minutes later, you're on College Ave. You stay on the bus instead of walking because, it's cold out, the bus isn't that crowded and really, it doesn't take much longer and you still have plenty of time. Besides, it's the class after an exam, there won't be too many people there anyway.

<br /><br />9:39
<br/>You arrive at your first class of the day: Intro to Logic, under the dorms. You're not sure why you bother coming since you learned all this stuff back in Discrete I, but it gives you time to read blogs and chat with your friends before your 11:30 class. You were right, not a lot of people here. You feel like having a piece of gum, but you can't find any in your pockets. You take your usual seat in the back by the outlet, plug in your lappy and wake it up. It takes a while, but it does... and then reboots... The thing has a mind of its own. Well, it hasn't been rebooted in a few days. It's done doin' its thing. You start typin'. OK, so you cheated a little. Actually it's 11:03pm the night before and you're typing out some of this ahead of time because you know you don't have much time in the morning. So you fix it up, add in little details. --/end cheat--
<br/><img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic5.jpg"" align=""left"">Your professor announces you learn proof today: ""direct proof and indirect proof."" You're still typing, you don't pay much attention, not that you have to. You decide maybe you should take some notes anyway since he tests on definitions. You decide to look for some gum again, you find some this time and have a piece. You have to clean out your flash card so you have room for lotsa pictures today. You decide to connect to the wireless internet too. ""Connected to RUWireless, Signal Strength: Excellent."" You log in. You have a myRutgers Alert? For what??? Oh right, our new RUID's. Ya, they don't wanna use our social security numbers anymore, so we gotta memorize a whole new number. They didn't even assign them yet. Just telling us they will. Like we didn't see the first 15 announcements.
<br/>Your professor's drawing weird lookin' animals on the board. He's so strange. You check your nation, The Spiffy Society of Short Sheep on Nation States. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic6.jpg"" align=""right"">""UN Category: Inoffensive Centrist Democracy, Civil Rights: Excellent, Economy: Good, Political Freedoms: Very Good. ... Short Sheep is ranked 10th in the region and 2,249th in the world for Largest Welfare Programs (per capita)."" Your computers flashing a lot of errors at you today... You read peoples' away messages. ""Away,"" ""Bleh"" guess Tom's still in a bad mood, ""Away,"" Emily has a longer one..., ""Away,"" ""Away."" *sigh* You spit out your gum. This class is so boring. Not as boring as Operating Systems though. He's talking about Mormons. o_O Grr, you really gotta learn to stop picking at your lips. Bad Lissy! You still do it even though you yell at yourself. Compulsive much? You put on chapstick. Your professor wants you to answer all the problems in the book. Ya, that'll happen.
<br/>Class is over, you pack up your stuff and leave.

<br /><br />11:10am
<br/>You walk over to your next class two buildings down and make a quick stop in the bathroom before going to your class. Ew, someone left a mess all over the one toilet seat. You wait for the other one. The hand dryer thingy doesn't work either. *sigh* You dry your hands on your pants.
<br/>Your second class of the day: Philosophy of Mind. In the same room number as the other class, just in a different building. Again, you take a seat in the back by the outlet. You'll need your battery power to type when you go visit Carolyn. You sit down and wake up your computer. The guy you went to HS with walks in. He hasn't said anything to you so far this semester. You doubt he even remembers you. You never talked in HS, why start now?

<br/>You log onto the wireless network. Would you stop picking at your lips! Has become such a bad habit now that you don't pick at your nails as much. That calcium you've been taking has made them stronger. Unfortunately you now take your stress out on your poor lips.
<br/>Your professor arrives a few minutes late. You check your site for comments. Oooh, new comments :D You put on your away message saying you're in class. You actually have to pay attention in this one. It's more interesting than your other three too. Also far less work than your writing class last year. Like one teeny reading a week, two papers and two exams. Speaking of which, he's going to pass around suggested topics for the first paper. It's due in two weeks. You add the date to your calendar. You sign the sign in sheet. Students are arguing with the professor about when the midterm's going to be. Right now it's the day after break is over. The class votes to change it to that Thursday instead. Wish that was an option for Data Structures Sophomore year, but your professor didn't schedule that exam, the stupid school did. 
<br/>Going over the Lewis reading today. Didn't we do that last week? Ned Block's the next class? Wasn't that supposed to be today? Wow we go slow. Hey, less reading for you. You take notes.<img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic8.jpg"" align=""right""> Gmail tells you you have a new e-mail from the housing people. No, you don't want to live in Rockoff next year, you already have an apartment. Oops, you missed something, what does that say? Anew or Fade? No... You stare at it for a while. Oh! True or False! Another new e-mail from the creation people telling you there's one more day to order autographed photos. People are debating about Phantom Limbs. You put on your jacket because you're cold. These people are entertaining. Eh, you picked at your finer and now it's bleeding a little. Wow, he's not gonna let you out early today? That's a first. You were just about to IM Carolyn when she IMs you. You tell her he's gonna let you go soon (ya, he lets you out a little early) and you'll be there in like 30/40 minutes or so.
<br/>You walk very quickly to the EE bus stop because it COLD OUT! Not easy to do since it's mostly uphill. But get there just as a bus is pulling up. You wait until the loaded bus almost completely empties and finally you get on and take a seat. Nice and warm :D A couple minutes later, the bus leaves for Douglass.

<br /><br />1:07pm
<br/>You arrive at the bus stop by the dining hall and call Carolyn to let her know you're here. You wait for her inside for a second. She tells you she's getting sick. Uh ohs. You get some sort of chicken, tofu and fried rice plus a salad :P You sit with Carolyn's friends. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic9.jpg"" align=""left"">They mostly talk about music stuff. You finish eating and start type as Carolyn chats with Pedro. You suggest getting frozen yogert. You do. Yummy strawberry with oreos! Frozen yogurt goooood. 
<br/>After eating and chatting, you walk over to Carolyn's dorm. You say you dunno if you wanna sit on the germ infested bed. You do anyway. You'll probably catch her cold regardless. You like her bed. It much higher than yours. That cool. You talk about the new RUID numbers. Carolyn's like, how we supposed to memorize this? You say the same way you memorized your social security number. She tries to convince you it's not the same. She visits cuteoverload.com. You log onto RUWireless. You comment that it says the signal's very good today, usually it says it pretty bad. You say maybe it depends on where you are in the room since you're about a foot away from where you usually sit. You test to see if there's a lag now that you both have Trillian, there is. You chat back and forth online, lol. You check your site comments. New one from Mere. He he, ""Hooray for finding a home! Although, boxes can be nice too. =)"" You start reading this to Carolyn and get to the part about your book. You think... hey, where is your book. You look around you. Uh oh. You and Carolyn go back to the dining hall to get it. That damn book causes more trouble! We didn't even use it today! From now on you're scanning the readings in.
<br/>You ask the lady if anyone found a Philosophy book. She says yesterday, but no, this was today. She lets you go look for it. You find it on the table where you left it surrounded by confused peoples. You walk back to Carolyn's dorm. You ask her if she wants to watch the end of Passions. She puts it on for you :) Grr, stupid spam IMs! You watch some weird flash animation. You watch the silly Harry Potter animation. You get an e-mail: Tutor's Wanted. Great grammar there. You wonder if that's something you should think about doing.

<br /><br />3:00pm
<br/>Time to go. You got laundry and homework to do. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic11.jpg"" align=""left"">Carolyn walks you outside and you see the F bus. You try to run and catch it, but no, too late. Oh well. Carolyn waits with you until an EE comes. Should you get off at the last stop and wait for a REXB or take the EE to College Ave and wait for an A or an H. You decide, since it's not too cold, waiting for an REXB is the better choice since it's faster... most of the time. And that bus stop is the warmest one out of all of them. The sun hits it just right or something. Always like 10 degrees warmer there. So you get off and you wait. And you wait, and you wait. You see several REXBs and Ls pass by in the other direction. Finally, after almost 30 minutes, one finally comes down your way. You notice your daddy called at some point so you listen to his message and call him back to tell him yes, you are taking the train back with Carolyn tomorrow and no, you do not have off until spring vacation X( 
<br/>You take the bus back to Busch and get off at the Serc stop since it doesn't go by the dorms. You walk back. Finally, 3:45 you make it back to your dorm. You ask your suitemates if they know whose week it is to clean. No one seems to have any idea. That makes you feel a bit better. And you didn't particularly want to clean the toilet anyway.
<br/<!--more-->>But you do have to do your laundry. You separate your clothes: Stuff that needs to be washed today, other stuff that doesn't so much. You go to the machines. Someone has stuff in the dryer, but the wash is free, so you put your stuff in. It'll be done at 4:35. You go back to your room and hook up your computer. Cynthia comes in (that's your roommate by the way) and you tell her that no one seems to know whose week it is to clean. She said she just saw Deyo cleaning this morning. But, you just asked her. OK, whatever, we clean next week. You should do your homework, or at least scan in those readings so you don't have to worry about your stupid book anymore. You do that. Well that was more trouble than it's worth. 

<br /><br />4:35pm

<br />You go take your stuff out of the wash, put it in the dryer and put your next load in. They'll be done at 5:20. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic14.jpg"" align=""right"">You look at your copies, they look pretty bad. Why couldn't they have an online book. Bleh. You go put two bottles of water in the fridge so Adi doesn't have to drink warm water again.
<br />You're sleepy all of a sudden. How you supposed to do homework when you're sleepy? You don't wanna do your programming assignment! You check out Shiny Shiny. Wow, a <a href=""http://www.shinyshiny.tv/2006/02/icool_smelly_mp.html"" target=""_blank"">Scented MP3 Player</a>. You go to your mySpace to listen to Banana Phone which Krissy dared you to put on your profile yesterday. You go read friends' LJs. Your LJ isn't pretty anymore since they disabled your layout for some reason. Something about security? They did it to a bunch of people. Ya know, maybe if we didn't have to use the stupid overrides and could just use normal CSS code like the rest of the universe, there wouldn't be a problem! You go check out deviantArt. No one's uploaded anything new... Well you can't start your homework now. You gotta go get your laundry in a few minutes. You check what the dining hall's gonna have for dinner. You see there's a speed dating thing on College Ave tonight. Hmm, naw. You already refused to go to Douglass to make chocolate with Carolyn, she'd kill you if you went to that instead. Besides, Adi's coming over for Farscape. They have another one the 28th. Well that's after Valentines Day, that kinda defeats the purpose, lol. 

<br /><br />5:20pm
<br />You go and fetch your clothes. There's a guy there waiting to do his laundry and is probably quite relieved to see you. Lotsa people doin' their laundry today. He says he likes your slippers. <img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic15.jpg"" align=""left"">:P You take your clothes out of the dryer and put your next load in. 6:00 you gotta check again. You decide maybe you should start the programming assignment. You write it out on paper first. You think better on paper. The other day, the TA told you to do it a different way from what your professor said, so you gotta look up the function he told you to use in your notes. Hmm... you better look some stuff up. This fork stuff is every so slightly more complicated than the I/O stuff and since you don't exactly pay attention during lecture, you're not 100% sure what you're doing, but the site you look up makes things a bit clearer. Now you just gotta program it. You go to fetch your laundry first.<img src=""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic16.jpg"" align=""right"">

<br /><br />6:00pm
<br />Yo",,,,,,,
 it's every time you copy something that you get an error from the google bar dictionary thing. It's 7:05," you're supposed to call Adi and leave him a message to remind him to come over since he can't remember on his own. You do. You put your phone on ring so you'll actually know when he calls and not make him sit in his car for 20 minutes before you realize you're a ditz. You only did it once... <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic17.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">Almost done writing your program. This really is easy. Not that you're complaining or anything. Nothing wrong with easy. You don't feel like running it right now. You'll wait until like Monday or Tuesday for that. Yeah... Though that leaves you with nothing to do... You can uh... comb your hair! Anything to keep from doing homework.",,,,,,,,
 that reminds you, you never looked up the dinner menu even though you said you were going to... anyway, he says we can have popcorn. You explain that popcorn isn't dinner and that you could lend him money. He says no. Pfft. Whatever, your hair isn't even dry yet and you're in ur PJ bottoms,,,,,,
 you were going to go check when your advisor has office hours tomorrow. Since you're gonna be here on a Friday morning, may as well go. You dunno if you should bother. They're pretty clear about requirements and you're pretty sure you've completed them all, well, except the number of credits. And they don't help with major/minor requirements anyway. Though she may know some easy classes you can take next semester as fillers...,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
" you're a little cold without your robe so you put on a sweatshirt. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic19.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You check the dinner menu. Nothing really good. Chicken parm", eh. You decide to pack a little while you wait. Well that didn't take very long. You don't have a whole lot to bring home with you as you left a lot of samples of your face goop and stuff there. Just gotta pack your Seasonale and you'll be done.,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
" it's been about 40 minutes since he called... Two minutes later the phone rings. Gah! It makes you jump! lol. Adi's here. You go and fetch Adi and tell him about your a Day in the Life of Lissy. And that the big TV is missing. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/4lifepic20.jpg"""" align=""""right"""">He tells you he's not going to read all this", he's just gonna scroll down to the part about him. Eh, probably only your mommy will read the whole thing. Hi mommy. You plug in the DVD player to watch Farscape, on the little TV. You bring your laptop in too and put on the first episode of season 3.,,,,,,
 sad ending, Zahn :( Ep's over. You put in the popcorn and take the water out of the fridge. Adi asks if you'd want to do a website if he got another artist for another comic, you say ya. He asks how will we know when the popcorn's done, you say when it's done or two seconds between pops. It beeps,,,,,,
 but hey, it's Farscape. A bad episode of Farscape is better than a good episode of any other show. Episode is kinda depressing though. Adi makes a bad joke about Virginia's makeup and her bad reaction to it cause her character isn't doin' so good. Some of your suitemates walk by and say hi. Cynthia asks Adi about his motorcycle. ,,,,,,,,

 that's right Abby's pregnant. You really gotta watch this show more often. Uh oh, someone gonna get killed.

He's shocked. You roommate puts on Sex and the City. How could you have forgotten about Sex and the City??? Greg says he's going to bed, you shoulda messaged earlier. But you was watchin' the Farscape. Aw, you wrote about your puppies too :( You miss your puppies. Usually you're home with them by now. Oh,,,,,,

 you lost... You try again. You got one again. This game sucks. You play one more time and then you'll give up. One yet again. OK, that's enough np wasted. You spin the Wheel of Excitement to try and win some of those np back, but you just loose some more. Ah well, you'll play a game later. You've run out of sites to visit. You decide to watch TV and play Mynci Volleyball since it's 2x the neopoints today. Aw,,,,,,

 put on your jacket and watch the last few minutes of Sliders. After it's over you quickly rush out the door since you now have only 12 minutes to get to class. You walk more swiftly than usual and arrive at class with 5 minutes to spare. You sit in your usual spot, two rows up and two seats in. You take out your Jornada. The kid sitting by you asks if it does wireless, you sadly reply, no. Two minutes left. Some dude walks in the classroom who isn't the professor and starts erasing the board... sub? You have something in your eye. Beh,,,,,,

 so you chew on a piece of sugar free spearmint gum. You finished the second chapter of the book and cross that reading off of your list of readings to do. You play solitaire while you wait for class to start. Your TA arrives and you all hand in your homework. You take out a pencil. Class begins. He goes over the homework. You picked the broken pencil again, you take out another one. You doodle. You run out of doodle room again, so you play solitaire. One card from winning. Frell. Oh well. You start a new game.

Also that Gilmore Girls is on at 8 and you have to take a shower before then. He asks if he can call after, but Sex in the City is on ? He doesnât know if his dad will let him call. You check your mail again. Your daddy e-mailed you back about transferring your site. He said we can do Friday. And he also said your database book came! Yay! You tell Cory he can call during Sex in the City. You usually never really watch it anyway since youâre always doing something on the computer. Plus, youâd rather talk to him today than tomorrow since you have the quiz to study for. He goes to ask his dad. You IM Greg a silly emoticon. Coryâs daddy said he can call, lol.

Hmm... which is the lesser of two evils? 10 minutes left. You're very bored. You would doodle, but you use your Jornada to type notes for this class and not so much fun doodling with a stylus. You check how much battery power you have left. 9/10," perty good. You decide you can listen to some music. You have some songs from your Walt Disney World soundtrack and the <i>Wicked</i> soundtrack on your flash card. You detach your headphones from your MP3 player and plug them in.

You have a new """"Ask the Computer Girl"""" from yesterday that you still haven't replied to. You think about changing the name of the subpage in light of recent grades... You visit the guild again. More new messages. The Farscape guild still doesn't though. Nothing new there either. You ask Rachelle what time she wants to eat. She says whenever you want to since her class got cancelled.

Rachelle suggests that since you both have to take extra classes that you take a class or two together over the summer at the community college. We shall see... You arrive at the Dining Hall. The girl at the front swipes your card. The place is crowded. The first section is all full," but you find seats in the second section and put your stuff down. You go and get food. They have stir fry tofu today :D yum. You get some of that and """"Hawaiian chicken."""" You go get your water from the funky water thing that likes to come out real slow. It's also a bit pink today since it has a little Hawaiian punch mixed in. Rachelle gets potatoes",,,,,,
 but you decide to walk back instead since it's not too cold out. You come back to the room, still an oven. Rachelle puts on the fan. You start on your Calc homework again.

 you have to go to bed early tonight because Rachelle has to get up early tomorrow. 11 hours of sleep may seem like a lot, but it takes you a good two hours just to fall asleep.

 so you decide to go back to sleep. Your alarm goes off at 6:35, you still don't get up. Your other alarm goes off at 6:40," you still don't get up. Your mom comes in at 6:45 to tell you the dogs were out and fed... you get up. You go say hi to Princess who is laying on your parent's bed. You and your puppies walk to the kitchen and you let them out and put up the gate. You go to the bathroom and brush your teeth. You let the dogs back in. You go downstairs to get clothes to wear. You pick out an oufit and try to find matching socks which takes you a bit too long. You finally prevail. You go to the bathroom and wash your face with a neutrogena facial cleansing cloth. <img src=""""http://www.silvercpu.com/gallery/Life_of_Lissy/lifepic1.jpg"""" align=""""left"""">You go and get dressed", brush your hair,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you sit up and turn off your TV and sit there for two minutes. You get up and walk towards the bathroom, your dog greets you, she wants you to pet her, you just wanna go to the bathroom.,,,,,,
 feed them, put Princess's dish downstairs, let Princess in, she goes downstairs,,,,,,
 but realize you haven'tput on your makeup yet. You put on some makeup and finish getting dressed. You then brush your hair.You love your haiir. It's so perty and long and soft... you go into the bathroom in the kitchen and brush your teeth with the electric toothbrush. Then you go back to your room and put on some more makeup. Then you wet your hands and put on some lotion and lipblam. Then you turn off the light, go in the kitchen get your bag, check for lunch money, and go out the doorto your mom's car.,,,,,,
 sit down, and talk to her. You take out yourJornada and start typing this. You check the time, it's 7:35. You put it away and talk to Kristen some more. Your history teacher walks by, you hide. You find out that Cara's not in school today because shehas Bergen Country Chorus. Kristen's friend,,,,,,
 so you go to physics. Now you can type more. You take out your jornada and do just that. Merry comes in late, she'son crutches still, she says hi to you. You're going to have a homework quiz, so you take out your sheet and look over it. Your teacher passes out the papers and you take the quiz. After you're done,,,,,,
 you say yes. You do warm-ups. Your teacher tells everyone they have to do ten pushups, you only do nine. You go down to the weightroom and go on the exercise bike, the seat's too high. You try to fix it, but you can't figure out how. You get back on the bike. One of the gym teachers walk by and asks how you are,,,,,,
 she's at a computer. You sign in. You find out now that you have to sign up to use a computer, how stupid is that.,,,,,,,,
 you both laugh. What the heck was that? LOL. You type some more. Merry asks you what you're doing so you tell her your doing another in the Life of Lissy thing. You type some more. Merry says she can't spell and asks you if you can spell social. You say, S-O-C-I-A-L...merry thought you said A-I-L... der, no, anyway... she then asks how you spell opertunities. Youre not sure,,,,,,
" """"something bad I hope."""" and merry says no and he says"," """"probably acurate anyway."""" he's funny. We talk about our teachers and our language finals. The bell rings", we get up to go into the class, but the door's locked. The teacher comes and unlocks the door. We walk in and you put her backpack down. You leave and go to the bathroom, you are close, he he. OK,what to do with the next three minutes... the school's clock is so slow.Your clock on your jornada (the correct time) says it's 10:55, the school's clock says it's 10:52. Bell just rang.. you walk to your locker. You put away your trapper, you math book and your bottle of water. You walk to Latin. Oops, you forgot your book. You won't need it anyway. You sit in Latin and type. He gives you something to translate. You translate it.
,,,,,,,,,
 ew little more than half. You hope you have enough for the rest of the day. That sheet was really easy. He gave you a midterm review sheet.You look over it and put the stuff you didn't have in your notes in your notes. You are very bored. You don'treally wanna play a game cause your woried about your battery life... what the heck... you play backgamon. You have the tiny toon theme song stuck in your heck, erg. You were loosing backgamon so you quit. The bell will ring soon. 90% of the class leaves before the bell rings, but you're always early for pre-calc, so you wait. You go to your locker and get your trapper and you math book. You go to pre-calc. You talk to Merry about latin and you sit down. LOL,,,,,,
 but there's a fire drill at the end of the period, so you go outside, come in, and go to American History. The door's locked. Rachelle passes by,,,,,,
 but to meet guys too. You also talk about the trip to disney world both of you will be taking this spring. Rachelle's mom comes. She gives you a ride home because your dad's still in Connectecut learning stuff. On the way home you discuss spiders and how evil they are. When you reach your house, you gatherup your belongings, get out of the car and go inside. You take down the gate for Buffy and the chairs for Princess. You let them out, get the mail,,,,,,
 say the opening with Quinn, close the unnecessary windows and plug your jornada in. You decide to go to the JUB. You hope the site actually loads this time. Nope, da JUB still doesn't work. You go to neopets instead. You check for new stuff and the procede to the rainbow skyz guild. Wait, you decide to enter the caption contest first. Now you go to your guild. Plug: The Rainbow Skyz Guild,,,,,,
 take out your contacts. Press record because you're recording ER and go to sleep or atleast try until the scene with Cater comes on and you just have to watch it cause he's so cute. Then you turn off the TV and go to sleep.,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 then you let Buffy and Princess out. You fed them. You went back to your room, put on your Mickey Mouse shirt, tan pants, yellow sweat shirt and yellow socks and your sneakers. You wipe your face with Biore face wipe and are about to wash off that icky stuff it leaves on your fancy,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 but at least you didn't repeat the second verse... You allow yourself to eat the tootsie roll pop you've been carrying around as a reward. Cherry... very yummy! Your throat that hurt a little feels better now.<br />,,,,,,,,,
 she said you could try out for the solo again today (as it turns out Erin and Devon got the solos again, arg). <br />,,,,,,,,
 so you leave them in there.<br />,,,,,,,,,
 you are the group's bank. You go and buy your lunch. Icky pizza, fries or a chocolate chip muffin... muffin. You also buy some yoo-hoo for a change. You never drink soda. Water usually. You return to your seat... Jackie's still absent (<i>with mono</i>) and Rachelle's not in school either. Darn. You talk to Anastasia a bit, eat your lunch, drink your yoo-hoo and write in your journal for your webpage (<i>this</i>). God knows you have nothing better to do. You draw a smiley face on your nail with your purple pen. You're very tired... Anastasia gives you a watermelon sour patch kid. Oh,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 so you're using purple instead. OK, you got a lot right that you guessed on. You're convinced you're psychic. OK, maybe not... Algebra's almost over... you discuss the SATs and PSATs with Susan and Angela is still taking her make-up test. You have a 92 average in this class. Not too bad.<br />,,,,,,,
 nice of your teacher to not tell you that your homework wasn't due 'till tomorrow... Just an average day at Liver Dull High School. You took a quiz. You got 3 wrong. You made a dumb mistake. You go to English and wish Gloria and happy belated birthday. You're going down to the library to work on your quote projects today. There was a fire drill... now you're back in the building. You're trying to narrow down the quotes you want to use for your project. You need 10, you have over 30, but narrowed it down to 13... not a good number... now you have 12. That works, since that's the # you need. English is over. School is over,,,,,,
 so you better go sign in... The lights aren't the way they're supposed to be so Ms. Smith is messing with them. Before during DE, Erin said that next years schedule might be 4 periods that are like 80 minutes each... You would kill yourself. It's like 3:02 now... You sing warm-ups along with the rest of the chorus of course. You had gone to your locker before class started because no one was here yet. You got your jacket," hat and AH book and Spanish book. Right now you're holding Lucky Alien Dude still from DE. You're writing and singing at the same time! He he... sing scales... Do Re Me Fa So La Ti Do... Now you're going to sing """"I've Got Shoes."""" Now you sing """"Since First I Saw Your Face."""" Ms. Smith announced Thursday you meet in the Auditorium (you're in the Little Theater now) 3 soloists aren't it"," it was funny :) The vice principal comes in and asks about rows. You showed Angela what you wrote about her. You're missing a crescendo. Next you sing """"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy."""" Now the guys leave and the girls sing """"Carol of the Bells."""" You will leave now",,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
 you order a plain whopper with cheese and onion rings. You come home, put down your stuff, greet Buffy, take down the gate,,,,,,
" so the puppies ran in your room. Princess is sittin with you and watchin TV and lookin for something to eat. You yell at her a wittle cause she's eatin stuff she shouldn't be. """"Don't Eat That Tissue!"""" You let the puppies out", bush your teeth... wait, you did that when you put your retainer in... brush your hair, put on your purple PJs,,,,,,

12/30/2010 14:25,12/30/2010 18:25,"Iâm Elissa, or Lissy depending on how cute you want to be. 

I am a graduate of Rutgers University with a BS in Computer Science. My husband, Bryan, also graduated from Rutgers. We met while he was working at the convenience store on campus. He looked me up on Facebook because he thought I was pretty <3 We got married on 1/3/2010.

I work at AT&T in New Jersey. Currently I'm doing web development in Java. I enjoy designing websites and programming in general, as long as pointers aren't involved. My favorite programming languages are Java, PHP and XSL. I spend most of my time online reading blogs.

I love my family (including puppies) and friends more than anything. I feel very lucky that I have so many awesome people in my life.

I exercise six days a week, mostly so I can eat more food. I really like food, especially Japanese food, Indian food and spaghetti, with Trader Joeâs Meatless Meatballs. Ooh, and pizza. I eat a lot of pizza. I love smores, cookies, Gobstoppers and ice cream. I make the best smores ice cream.

I watch quite a few shows, often while exercising: House, Glee, Grey's Anatomy, The Big Bang Theory and Gossip Girl. Bryan and I also love Farscape and Firefly.

I like to sing. See my <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/etcfiles/evilsquirrels.wmv"">Evil Squirrels video</a>. I like happy music. I mostly listen to Broadway, Disney, Christmas music during the season, plus other random stuff.

<!--more-->

6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/c-ijP25774w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end.

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-0321.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-0321-178x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""178"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3754"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight.

Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you've either not been sleeping or dreaming that you've not been sleeping. You get out of bed and turn it off and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone yesterday so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. You have trouble doing all of the pushups early in the DVD and the arm exercises on the playground ball towards the end. It's also hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your coach ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably be over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if we should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. ou ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on like 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. That always becomes a sensitive subject, who's an active member and who's not, but you think you're doing the right thing by just keeping track on an individual basis what everyone does. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great.

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. Or now if Lyn's reading the blog :) 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.

You go up and pick out a different outfit. You brush your teeth, wash your face and put on a night shirt. You start reading your book. It's about wolves... they hunt and stuff. The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. 

",A Day in the Life of Lissy 2012,,,,,,
3/16/2012 9:58,3/16/2012 13:58,"6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you've either not been sleeping or dreaming that you've not been sleeping. You get out of bed and turn it off and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone yesterday so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. You have trouble doing all of the pushups early in the DVD and the arm exercises on the playground ball towards the end. It's also hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your coach ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably be over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if we should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. ou ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on like 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. That always becomes a sensitive subject, who's an active member and who's not, but you think you're doing the right thing by just keeping track on an individual basis what everyone does. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adelle. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. Or now if Lyn's reading the blog :)

You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan says goodnight.

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 010"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3739"" /></a>

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 011"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3737"" /></a>

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight. ",A Day in the Life of Lissy 2012,,,,,,
3/17/2012 11:36,3/17/2012 15:36,"6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/c-ijP25774w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end.

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight.

6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/c-ijP25774w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with.

You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end.

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting!

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight. ",A Day in the Life of Lissy 2012,,,,,,
3/15/2012 18:29,3/15/2012 22:29,"6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you've either not been sleeping or dreaming that you've not been sleeping. You get out of bed and turn it off and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone yesterday so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. You have trouble doing all of the pushups early in the DVD and the arm exercises on the playground ball towards the end. It's also hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your coach ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably be over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a null pointer obsessed developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy and event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Now it's giving an error with the xsl files. You ask him if he has the xsl files, though he doesn't need them. It matched a filter and that's what he's trying to test.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, you say yes.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. You can't get a decent picture of yourself in the mirror. 

On the way back you say hi to Rich. You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if we should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. ou ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on like 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. That always becomes a sensitive subject, who's an active member and who's not, but you think you're doing the right thing by just keeping track on an individual basis what everyone does.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great.

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 010"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3739"" /></a>

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 011"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3737"" /></a>

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight.

<!--more-->

6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

<iframe width=""560"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/c-ijP25774w"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 010"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3739"" /></a>

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 011"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3737"" /></a>

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now.

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight.

We watched Final Destination 5 Saturday night. The movie was mediocre, but the ending made it worth sitting through. I thought it was very clever and for a movie with such a poor script, they really put some effort into it.

Sunday my dad and I went to see The Hunger Games. It was pretty awesome. Not as good as the book of course, but I felt they couldn't have done a better job. It seemed a little too fast paced, but they had so much they had to squeeze in in so little time and if it didn't move fast, it would have dragged. The second book is probably going to be crazy.

Yesterday I finally emailed the gown preservation company to ask for an estimate. My mom and I went upstairs to take a picture of my dress. Happy to report it hasn't turned yellow or anything. Actually, it looks exactly the same as when I first brought it home from the bridal shop. Guess I didn't get very dirty that day. Still, it should be cleaned and put away properly.

Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.



You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 010"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3739"" /></a>

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 011"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3737"" /></a>

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight.

6:30am
Your alarm goes off. You didn't sleep well last night. Actually, for the last two hours you either haven't been sleeping or dreaming that can't sleep. You get out of bed and turn off your alarm and your backup alarm so it doesn't wake Bryan. You use your phone as a flashlight and head into the other bedroom to grab your robe. You go downstairs and take your breakfast out of the fridge. You put a glass of water in the microwave. You like drinking hot water in the morning to warm you up. You have about 1/4 of your breakfast, peanut butter and jelly overnight oats and put the rest back in the fridge. You drink your water as you check your email and facebook on your phone. You go to put your phone in your bag, but you remember Bryan brought up your phone case/wallet with your phone last night, so it's still upstairs. You grab your phone case from the bedroom and hang it with your clothes so you don't forget it later. You go to the bathroom upstairs, put in your contacts and brush your teeth. You put on your workout clothes and make your way to the basement.

You put on your exercise DVD: Physique57 Arm and Ab Booster. It's probably your most challenging workout. It's hard staying in a crunch position without your hands behind your head. Your neck starts to hurt and you have to complete some of the exercises on your back.

After the 30 minute DVD, you put on Doctor Who and do some lunges, squats, and other lower body exercises to finish up. You stretch for a bit and then it's back upstairs for a shower.

Once you're nice and clean, you put on your acne stuff (the nice weather has caused you to break out pretty badly) and lotion. You comb and towel dry your hair. You put on some foundation and under eye concealer. You get dressed, put on your earrings and grab your party shoes. Back downstairs, you pack your breakfast, lunch and snack. You put on comfortable walking shoes, your jacket and your fancy ID holder. It's supposed to be a little chillier than yesterday. You grab your Disney purse, your keys, lunch bag, shoes and head out to your car. 

8:35am
It's not raining, so no Parkway today. Definitely overcast though, and chilly, you put on the heat. 35 would be faster if the lights were timed better. You sing a little. Really ""Time of Your Life"" again? You were sick of that song 10 years ago, why do they feel the need to play it every day. You don't get stuck at too many reds today, but it doesn't matter, people are slow. The clock at S Laurel and 35 says 8:55, so you'll be in your office around 9:05. You pull into the parking garage and pull though into a spot. You run across the bridge because it's cold! You say hi to someone at the elevator and take the stairs up to the fifth floor. You say hi to Patti in the hall. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-004-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 004"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3732"" /></a>

When you arrive at your office, Maryam tell you your timezone conversion function you wrote doesn't work. Wha? Anthony Q'd you. He says his XML isn't working. You ask him what the error is. Outlook is asking for a password, so you restart it. Maryam says EST and CST return the same time. That's stupid. If they're both Standard, they should both return Standard, not Daylight. She has to use the name of a city instead. You eat the rest of your breakfast and chew some gum.

Anthony says he's using the wrong config. Julia asks what she should put for title in the missing receipt form. You didn't fill it out, but you assume she should put her title. She says she forgot your brownie. You tell her your readers were looking forward to that brownie and she's ruined everything. She says she has forever changed history.

There's an optional NDR meeting at 10. You have time to go, but since it's with Mary and the REs, the conversation will probably go over your head anyway. Ah, your email has arrived. You were invited to a CP12 meeting at 10:30 anyway. Don asks how the One Team presentation to leadership went yesterday. You told him they were pretty happy overall.

Maryam comes in and wants to ask you a question. You like the flower doodle on her notes. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-005.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 005"" width=""400"" height=""262"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3733"" /></a>

She wants to know about threads in Java. Brij walks by and says hi. You tell her if her program isn't going to be doing multiple things at once, it doesn't need to be threaded, but having a for loop that continuously polls the database probably isn't the best way to do this. She's going to talk to the people on her team about it.

Anthony is still having problems. Sounds like he needs some test xml from Eddie. He doesn't even have the xsd to generate his own xml. You look at his log file to see if you can help. His code is due tomorrow, yuck. You tell him he can try getting logs from ST or prod.

Manoswita Q's you, ""Hi Elissa...need ur advice since u r leading the way with CARE."" She wants to know what needs to be done for the code review. You tell her what you did and to find a time that a certain null-pointer-obsessed-developer is busy :D

You get some hot water and drink it with your gum. It brings out the flavor. You ask Anthony if he's found anything. You tell him to look at 3112. You go to the logs and copy an event for him. You forget the security header so you add in one of those. It's been way too long since you've done this weblogic stuff, though you're surprised how much you remember. Seems to be working.

10:29am
You dial in to the CP12 meeting. The pin code doesn't work. You get the feeling these people don't use t-meeting much. You receive an email with the correct pin. You want to go over the code before your code review later, but with this meeting and the One Team meeting you won't have time. You open up the code to look at it now. They ask if you're on the call, you say yes. Golly you've gone through a lot of gum already today. OK, you're done after this piece. You tell Anthony where he can find the ear file. They ask on the call if you did your CP12 ID, yes, you have.

You send Sean the updated code review record. You ask him what line in one of the files he changed because you can't find it. CP12 meeting is over. You change into your pretty shoes and go to the bathroom. You say hi to Brian on the way there and he remarks how high your shoes are. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-007-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 007"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3734"" /></a>

You go back to reviewing code. Great, you chewed too much gum and now your tummy is making noises. You print a copy of the One Team list for attendance. You print a copy of the review record to take notes on. You fetch them from the printer. You go through the code and write down the lines that have changed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-008.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 008"" width=""400"" height=""238"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3735"" /></a>

11:30am
Time to eat! You go to the microwave to heat up the leftover baked ziti you made yesterday, your favorite! You come back to your office while it heats up and do more work. On the way back to the microwave you say hi to Ramya. You finish your notes and your food. You call your daddy to see if he picked up your dress yesterday. He's not picking up, maybe he's in the city today, you leave a message. You chew more gum. You print the meeting agenda you wrote up yesterday and fetch it. You also pick up the candidate's resume you printed out and left there before the interview yesterday. You look up your host pin and write it at the top of the page. One Team meeting time. Brij says you're pink today.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-009.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 009"" width=""800"" height=""362"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3736"" /></a>

You dial into your bridge and Maryam helps take attendance. You talk about Take Your Kids to Work Day, the April coffee break, fundraising, the summer picnic and what it means to be an active member. Jill talks a little about brown bags, but you're going over time so you have to cut her off. You end the meeting and walk back to your office. Julius says he likes you shoes. You ask Sumayya and Maryam if you should walk at 2, you have a meeting at 1. They're OK with that. You edit the activity sign up list for One Team to add the committees you discussed in the meeting. You let Dave know he was nominated at the head of the other activities committee. You really don't want to do this code review, but this is the worst thing you'll have to do all week, so it's not so bad. Maybe you should go to the bathroom before... yes, that's probably a good idea. You say hi to Gil on the way back to your office.

12:55pm
You connect to your meeting early since sometimes it asks for your password and you don't know your password. Chrome has saved it, so you're OK this time. You can't wait to get this over with. Javadocs, wrong file, bleh. It was only half an hour, but you have to make changes in several files. One change you have no idea how to do. You ask Sean if you should meet later to sort out who's doing what. Renee Q's you, asks how it went. You told her OK, but you have changes. You'll try to make them by tomorrow and yes, you recorded the session. You discuss with Sean how to fix the difficult item. More gum chewing while you try to get your env in working order. You suggest the problem is on line 487 of one of the jspf files. Sean looks at the error in the debugger and says you're right. You tell him you have psychic powers and he asks for lotto numbers.

You email your CP12 manager your contact number and ask her about driving the truck. You tell her you don't think you're tall enough. You change your shoes, walk time. You talk about work and stuff. Maryam asks about the interview meeting later. You told her the process has changed a bit and now there's a form to fill out where you have to rate the candidate and you have to give the whole question packet to Meera at the end. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-010-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 010"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3739"" /></a>

You and Maryam are talking about the timezone issue and Sumayya says she knows what CST and EST are :) Maryam is impressed by Yiding's java coding skills. You tell Maryam that Sean will have the code fixed by the time you go back upstairs. He does. You tell him what you told Maryam. He says you found it, he just fixed it. You didn't find it, you guessed. He says he's coming upstairs. Good, you can finally give him his CP12 souvenir you bought to alleviate your guilt over the fact he did all the work on this project. Your code is still publishing. You didn't have anything else to do this week, you should have checked to see if your environment was working BEFORE you had things to fix.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-011-225x300.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 011"" width=""225"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3737"" /></a>

2:30pm
Sean comes up and you give him his coffee mug. He said he actually needed one. Yay. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-015-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 015"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3738"" /></a>

You tell him you still need to give Manoswita her souvenirs from Italy and Disney. You split the work up, but realize you'll have to send emails to get clarification on some things. After Sean leaves, Terry comes to ask about switching bagel days. You can't because you have meetings at 10 every Wednesday. He asks you about the overtime travel policy and you both decide he's worked enough today and should go home. You email people your questions on the code review items. Turns out your local env is working. You say hi to a bunch of different people in the hall. You apologize to Abe about the whole ""active member"" thing in the meeting today. Lindsey's a fan of your shoes too.

You Q Manoswita to see if she's in the office so you can bring her her souvenirs, but she's not. You tell her you'll have to buy her something better 'cause she'll be like wow, she waited all this time for this junk? :P Hmm, maybe your environment isn't working. Uncaught exception. Great. Null pointer. Great. This one's new, you've never seen it before. Looks like the latest version of one of the files is causing a compilation error, but you guys didn't change those files... And you're getting the same error even with the old file. Best way to solve a problem is by typing out your question to someone else. You get an idea while typing the ""help me"" email. Ah, it worked! You'll have your snack early since you have a meeting at 4. Yogurt with tropical fruit. You email Sean to tell him the one issue is fixed.

Maryam picks you up for the meeting and comments that the writing on your whiteboard in your office has been there for a long time. You walk to the meeting room, but everyone is hanging out in the hall. Looks like the room was taken. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-016-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 016"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3740"" /></a>

You all go into one of the other rooms. You comment on Sherryl's huge stack of papers. She says, yeah, they're double-sided too. You take a picture of Meera setting up her laptop, but she makes you delete it :D You show Maryam the pictures you've taken so far. She goes over the presentation. She asks you if you have any comments on the rating section since you're the only one that's used it so far. You share your experience. After the meeting you tell Maryam about how your candidate yesterday answered one of the critical thinking questions. Reuven talks about how he answered it and how you and Leon looked at him like he was crazy. You don't remember that, you just remember he was a good candidate. He asks you guys if you like interviewing, because you do it a lot. You say yeah, and it's good for improving interview skills. 

More gum chewing. You work on your code review items some more. The ""new"" file you were told to use looks like it's missing some new changes from the ""old"" file, so you'll need another email to confirm which one you should use. 

5:27pm
Almost time for you to leave. Sean asks, ""my UATP mail had the voting button on there.. right? I haven't seen any responses yet"" You ask him if he knows all the responses go to the deleted items folder. He didn't. Yay, you helped. You look for some javadoc guidelines in the documentation folder, but don't see any. You hope they let you know exactly what they want you to change. You go to put your time in. You're unsure what to put for lunch since you took your lunch/walk at 2:00. That counts. Exactly 8 hours. That's how you know it's a slow week. Time to go! You change your shoes and pack up your stuff. Your black boots are really falling apart. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-017-300x216.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 017"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3742"" /></a>

You walk down the stairs and scan yourself out at the door. Damn it got colder! You sprint to the car. It's Cold, it's cold, it's cold. Parkway home. The lights on the road to the parkway are timed poorly as well. Not much traffic. Difficult to make the turn off of the exit today. You make a car slow down for you. You sing along to Adele. You wonder if the cop in the car next to you is watching you sing. Your neighbor parked next to your spot has both of their doors open. Are they actually cleaning out the car??? You park as close to the curb as possible. You drop your keys while opening the front door. Before taking off your jacket, you heat up your dinner (more ziti!) and get water from the fridge with the new water filter you just got. Exciting! 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-018-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 018"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3741"" /></a>

You bring your food to your PC so you can eat and type. You forgot the parm and you have to pee, so you get up. You come back from the bathroom, but you forgot to bring your food back with you. You go back into the kitchen to cheese it up and bring it back and eat. Yum. You eat a small piece of chocolate for dessert. You go back into the kitchen to pack up your lunch, breakfast and snack for tomorrow. You're making yourself apple and peanut butter oats for breakfast. You cut up the apple, throw in some oats, peanut butter, chia seeds, almond milk and cinnamon and stick it in the fridge. 

Someone rings the doorbell. You look out the window and see a guy holding an envelope. Maybe he got your mail? He power washes decks, he gives you a flyer. You spoon out some yogurt and and frozen fruit for your snack. You do the dishes, take your fish oil  and start tidying up a bit. The doorbell rings again. Really? It's a couple of girls selling chocolate. You're about to say you don't want any, but remember trying to raise money for things when you were a kid. You buy an almond and two caramel.  You come back to your PC to check on your castle. You eat a couple bites of the caramel. Wow that's super sweet. Oh gosh, you have a lot of clay now. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/2012castle.jpg"" alt="""" title=""2012castle"" width=""500"" height=""281"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3729"" /></a>

You accidentally summon a gloom wolf instead of killing one. Time to do all that cleaning you've been putting off all week. You clean some stuff off the kitchen table, clean the sink upstairs and the counters in the kitchen and the kitchen table. You never realize how dirty the house is until you have to clean it. Bryan's late. You check your phone to see if he called, he hasn't. You give the floor a much needed sweeping. All clean! Well, close enough. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-020-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 020"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3743"" /></a>

You go upstairs to put your clothes away, but on the way you notice you never set the thermostat ahead for daylight savings. No wonder it's so cold. Bryan comes home. Bryan! You give him a kiss. You explain about the thermostat and the chocolate. You go upstairs to put the clothes away from your load of darks. He comes up to give you hugs and kisses. You pick out your clothes for tomorrow.

8:00pm
You call your daddy again to ask about the dress. He did pick it up, but when he dropped off his old car at the dealership when he picked up his new truck (don't call it a car), he left the dress in his old car. He realized when he got home and had to go back and get it. He asks about Easter at your place. You tell him it's OK with Bryan and that you're having dinner with Bryan's parents on Saturday so you can ask them then. 

You're hungry. You eat some of the cereal Bryan hates. More castleville. You finally got that last gloom rat tail. You go get some water. You ask Bryan if he's exercising tonight, since he usually doesn't on Thursdays. He says no. That means more Doctor Who watching for you while jumping on the trampoline. You go to the bathroom and then head downstairs for some jumpin' Doctor Who time. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-023-1024x768.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 023"" width=""540"" height=""405"" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-3746"" /></a>

It's a good episode too. Epic. After jumping for 30 minutes, you stretch. You stay watching the episode longer than you planned since it's a two-parter and you want to see what happens. You don't finish it though. Maybe you'll watch the rest upstairs later on your phone. You head back upstairs. Bryan says he loves you. Little more castleville and some blog reading before bed. You check the weather for tomorrow to make sure your outfit is appropriate. Eh, you should probably wear short sleeves.


<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-031-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 031"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3745"" /></a>

9:45pm
You go up and pick out a different outfit. You floss, brush your teeth and wash your face. You acne goop tube seems to have come apart. It won't close properly. You call down to Bryan that it's bed time. He says he knows. He comes upstairs. He wants the peanut butter thing. From uno's? Yeah. You put on your firefly t-shirt. Bryan goes to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/dayinlife2012-032-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" title=""dayinlife2012 032"" width=""300"" height=""225"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3747"" /></a>

You start reading your book on your kindle. It's about wolves... The main character is kinda stupid, but she's a wolf, so you guess you can't expect too much. She also has a thing going on with her cousin/brother, so that's a little weird. Bryan's out of the shower. You cuddle. It's cold. You're going to need another blanket. You don't know where Cheryl's blanket is. Bryan wants to know if he should look for it for you. You dunno. If it's not on either of the couches, you don't know where it could be. Maybe on the chair in the other bedroom or on one of the dining room chairs. Bryan checks the bedroom, that's where it was. You cuddle some more before Bryan puts on the fan and says goodnight. ",A Day in the Life of Lissy 2012,,,,,,
6/25/2012 12:29,6/25/2012 16:29,"I missed a week, but nothing much happened that week, so I'll move on :)

We had Agile training at work this past week. You may have seen my pictures of a marshmallow tower and a house made out of index cards on facebook. Probably the best class I've taken here so far. 90% of it was interesting and I only felt like falling asleep about twice. That could have been from the excessive amount of caffeine I consumed though. I was bouncing off the walls, shaking, yelling at my team members to build the house faster. Good times. 

Getting to work early every day sucked. I woke up at the same time as usual and just exercised after work instead of before, but it was terrible because I was here an hour and a half early, but I only left like 15 minutes earlier than usual. I made up most of the time through slightly longer lunches and I left a little earlier, but I felt like I lost more time than I gained. As a result, the house was a disaster all week and spent a good chunk of Sunday morning cleaning.

Saturday was Cheryl and Yori's going away party. They're moving to Portland because they suck. Or maybe because they're awesome. Too early to tell. There was a flying shark, water balloons, bubbles, pin the sperm on the egg. You know, the usual.

Sunday I hung out with my friends up North. Rachelle spilled the beans about Carolyn's shower which was extremely amusing. We had dinner at On the Border for Krissy's birthday.

I exercise, I'm hot. I get out of the shower, I'm cold. I get into my car, I'm hot. I turn on the AC in the car, I'm cold, I turn off the AC, I'm hot, turn it on, I'm cold. I get out of my car, I'm hot. I walk into my building, I'm freezing. I drink some hot water, I'm hot. I go to the bathroom down the hall, cold again. I drink more hot water, hot, 30 minutes later, cold. I eat lunch and talk a walk, I'm really hot. I go to a meeting on the fourth floor, omg it's the freakin' artic! Hot water, hot, yogurt snack, cold. Home to my 80 degree house, hot. AC brings it down to 78, cold. Apparently my sweet spot is around 79 degrees if I'm not moving at all. Then I'm comfortable.

We were in the conference room on the fourth floor yesterday and it was unbelievably cold. I wanted my winter jacket.

I'm just happy my office is in one of the warmest spots in the building. I'm still sitting here in my jacket drinking warm water though. I also keep a blanket in my room that I use during the winter.

I'm supposed to be testing this native iPad app, but the screen's been loading for the past 30 minutes and I have little hope that anything will ever happen.

I've also spent a lot of time this week fighting with the Mac. I really need to get a mouse for that thing. It's frelling impossible to scroll using the touchpad. 

This past weekend we celebrated Emily's birthday at medieval times. Their vegetarian meal is absolutely delicious. I'm not a vegetarian, but I didn't enjoy the huge chunks of meat they gave us last time and the vegetarian meal looked so good, so that's what I got, and it was!

Last weekend we went into the city for Dim Sum, Karaoke and Korean food again.

Sunday I went with my girlfriends to see Magic Mike. They really could have cut the plot and dialogue in half. The rest of the movie was good :) We ate at Grand Luxe before hand :P

We had our company picnic at work this week. There was a lot of drama over the tug-of-war rope. I texted Roy Sunday night and he responds, ""who is this?"" Really? Who else is going to ask about a tug-of-war rope at 8:30pm on a Sunday? Well, besides Roy. I should have told him I was his boss. I ended up ordering one off of amazon with overnight shipping. The shipping would have been like $50, but amazon kindly asked, ""Do you want to save $45 on this order?"" ""Why yes, yes I do want to save $45!"" So I used my one month Amazon Prime trial and saved the day. Then Joe went and spent $80 on backing tracks and one of the service anniversary people didn't come to the picnic so we couldn't use his $200. That's a lot of bagel money we lost.

It didn't rain until around 4. We cut out one of the games, mostly because it was hot and people just wanted to hang out in the water or in the shade. We did the sand castle competition judging early because we heard thunder. Food was late, so we sang before it came out. Food sucked pretty bad. Otherwise things went pretty well. Some people actually did my scavenger hunt :) I think everyone had fun.

I took off yesterday and today, not because of the picnic, mostly. Rachelle, Chris and I were supposed to go to Six Flags yesterday, but that got scraped due to the possibility of more thunderstorms. I went to the Museum of Natural History instead. I guess I was still tired from Wednesday because I fell asleep during both the planetarium and IMAX movies. To be fair, the planetarium was just was too comfy and relaxing and the IMAX theater wasn't a real IMAX theater... I enjoyed the space and creatures of light exhibits. I bought a few friend for my office.

Today I'm hanging out with my daddy. I finally picked up my preserved wedding dress. ""How long has it been since the wedding?"" ""Two years ... and a half. I procrastinate."" She said she had a girl come in after four years, so it could be worse.

I also had to buy someone another shower gift because I accidentally left her's at home. Oops. Oh well, you can never have too many shower gifts. Unless they all can't fit in your car. Then I guess that's too many.",The Saga of the Rope,,,,,,

Went to the park and were there for about 30 seconds before it started raining like the world was going to end. And in that 30 seconds I managed to get another mosquito bite, that still itches, a lot.

Bryan met me at work yesterday and we went to the beach with Julia and peoples. Well, we carpooled with Julia and Jay and all four of us were running crazy late. Then we got lost because they're still doing construction and my GPS didn't know wtf was going. And then we parked in the wrong place. By the time we got to the beach it was around 7. I don't really care for the beach anyway, so an hour is more than enough time for me. I played with Julia's hula hoop. I'm getting much better.

Been watching some of the Olympics. Mostly I'm interested in women's gymnastics. Glad the US made it worth watching :) I think the best part of any of the events is watching their faces when they win. Imagine being at a party and you're like, oh yeah, I won an Olympic gold medal once; it was pretty cool.

Still following <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Tina's Best Body Bootcamp</a>. I tried running outside this morning for my cardio and it was a huge fail. It was hot and as much as I exercise. Just jogging brought my heart rate up too much. Probably had more to do with my unhealthy dinner last night, but I came back in and danced and did some Yoga instead. I couldn't even finish the Yoga. It requires at least some focus and I wasn't into it at all.

8/17/2012 9:39,8/17/2012 13:39,"The bachelorette party Saturday was a success! We needed a last minute replacement for Natalie, but Julia was able to bail us out because she's awesome like that :) Amazingly, everyone showed up at Carolyn's on time! We took pictures and they opened up their bachelorette party goodies. And wine, of course there was wine. I was driving to the restaurant though, so I wouldn't get to have any until the second half of the night.

We had dinner at It's Greek to Me in Ridgewood. The food was surprisingly good. It's a chain and I've been to a couple of other ones, but this one was a lot better. I ate too much :(

Then we headed back to Carolyn's to wait for the limo, gab and play some games. I found this game online when I was looking for shower games. I deemed it inappropriate for a shower, but perfect for a bachelorette party:
You have the guests write down their least favorite chore and why they don't like doing it. Then you read the answers replacing the chore with ""So and so doesn't like sex because...""
And hilarity ensues.

The limo arrived and it was awesome. We all agreed it was pretty much the highlight of the night. They stocked the limo with balloons (that we later sucked the helium out of), champagne, water, glasses, napkins. I really should have skipped the champagne, because as some of you know, I can't burp. And it wasn't really champagne, it was cheap, carbonated white wine. My tummy was upset the rest of the night. All the Greek food probably didn't help either.

But I still managed to have fun. We plugged in an iPhone and sang away to the best of the 80s and 90s and a little Call Me Maybe.

We arrived at Lips early and there were a lot of people waiting outside. We weren't sure if we were supposed to give our name or not. Even after we did we had to wait quite a while. We were finally seated about 45 minutes after we got there. We were then informed the kitchen was about to close, which wasn't an issue since they didn't seem to have any desserts anyway. They had a very limited selection of expensive cocktails, which didn't seem like a big deal since there was a $15 drink minimum anyway. Unfortunately, about half of us couldn't stomach another drink and ended up paying double for the first one. 

When I called them the first time they told me that for $15 each they'd bring the girls up on stage and dance with them or talk with them for a while, take their picture and then give them a brownie. That didn't happen. For $15 they were brought on stage and given a shot. Because we needed more alcohol, right? They didn't even ask them their names. Lame. Very lame.

Then we got the bill and it ended up costing a little less than the limo X( I expected it to be about $5 less pp and I felt bad because we couldn't pay for Carolyn and Rachi :( We were also $12 short somehow. I threw in the extra because I was so out of it I figured it was entirely possible I left out a $20. It was 1:30am and I had been hiccuping for the last hour, lol. I paid a little extra for the limo anyway, so I guess it worked out.

Julia and I used the men's bathroom. It was all women there so the women's room had a crazy long line and I wanted to get the hell outta there so we wouldn't be charged for going over on the limo. We weren't the only ones.

We made it out and home in time. The ride back was a little less enthusiastic. We were pretty tired. I felt like crap.

Everyone had a good time though. And I will never ever plan one of these again :) lol.

On a completely unrelated note, I found <a href=""http://www.realsimple.com/health/preventative-health/vaccines-00100000084158/index.html"">this excellent article on vaccines</a>.

Also, still following <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Tina's Best Body Bootcamp</a>. I think it has more to do with my diet lately, but I definitely lost a few pounds. Just have to maintain through Rachi's wedding so I look awesome in my super skinny black dress :)",The Bachelorette Party!,,,,,,

You have the guests write down their least favorite chore and why they don't like doing it. Then you read the answers replacing the chore with ""So and so doesn't like sex because...""
And hilarity ensues.

The limo arrived and it was awesome. We all agreed it was pretty much the highlight of the night. They stocked the limo with balloons (that we later sucked the helium out of), champagne, water, glasses, napkins. I really should have skipped the champagne, because as some of you know, I can't burp. And it wasn't really champagne, it was cheap, carbonated white wine. My tummy was upset the rest of the night. All the Greek food probably didn't help either.

But I still managed to have fun. We plugged in an iPhone and sang away to the best of the 80s and 90s and a little Call Me Maybe.

We arrived at Lips early and there were a lot of people waiting outside. We weren't sure if we were supposed to give our name or not. Even after we did we had to wait quite a while. We were finally seated about 45 minutes after we got there. We were then informed the kitchen was about to close, which wasn't an issue since they didn't seem to have any desserts anyway. They had a very limited selection of expensive cocktails, which didn't seem like a big deal since there was a $15 drink minimum anyway. Unfortunately, about half of us couldn't stomach another drink and ended up paying double for the first one. 

When I called them the first time they told me that for $15 each they'd bring the girls up on stage and dance with them or talk with them for a while, take their picture and then give them a brownie. That didn't happen. For $15 they were brought on stage and given a shot. Because we needed more alcohol, right? They didn't even ask them their names. Lame. Very lame.

Then we got the bill and it ended up costing a little less than the limo X( I expected it to be about $5 less pp and I felt bad because we couldn't pay for Carolyn and Rachi :( We were also $12 short somehow. I threw in the extra because I was so out of it I figured it was entirely possible I left out a $20. It was 1:30am and I had been hiccuping for the last hour, lol. I paid a little extra for the limo anyway, so I guess it worked out.

Julia and I used the men's bathroom. It was all women there so the women's room had a crazy long line and I wanted to get the hell outta there so we wouldn't be charged for going over on the limo. We weren't the only ones.

We made it out and home in time. The ride back was a little less enthusiastic. We were pretty tired. I felt like crap.

Why do they make so many shoes you can't walk in? So my mom suggested I get some makeup which I also need for the weddings. It was also pouring out and word was a tornado was whipping it's way through NJ, so they weren't letting people leave anyway. Sat down at the Clinque counter and the lady made me pretty. I ended up buying concealer, foundation, blush and mascara. The foundation is kinda magic. My face looked less red even after I took it off. Olive oil makes an awesome makeup remover btw... I suggest taking out your contacts first though or you will be forced to take them out when you get olive oil all over them.

Yesterday our little gang went to <a href=""http://www.applewoodwinery.com/"">Applewood Winery</a> in New York for some apple pickin'. There was wine tastin' first. I mostly tried the sweet stuff. I liked their blackberry wine, so I got a glass of that. Rachi bought a bag of donuts, so we had wine and donuts for lunch.  Once we were sufficiently tipsy, we picked ourselves some apples.

After the apples we headed to Sugar Loaf and looked through some of the cute stores. I got some amazing smelling soap in the shape of a jack-o'-lantern and now my whole house smells like pumpkin spice and it's awesome. We went out for dinner after at this fancy Asian fusion place with the slowest service ever considering we were pretty much the only ones there. The food was delicious though and reasonably priced.

I had two cards, that aren't appropriate to share on my blog, but I can tell you that no two cards together will ever be quite as awesome. Also, they were from two different decks so it was like all the stars aligned to bring those two cards together.

The party was pretty great. So great in fact, that we decided to take the later train back. I was glad we did because we would have missed some epic rounds of Cards Against Humanity. I had two cards, that aren't appropriate to share on my blog, but I can tell you that no two cards together will ever be quite as awesome. Also, they were from two different decks so it was like all the stars aligned to bring those two cards together. Oh, what the hell. No one reads this blog anyway:

I'll skip over the part where I came up to my parents and within 15 minutes of them leaving for the airport I locked myself out of the house and they had to come back to let me in. Yup, skipping over that part. Also going to skip over the part where I waited hours for the cable guy to come so he could fix the internet that was working fine all weekend and still continues to work just as well as before he came.

Then there was the rehearsal and the rehearsal dinner :P With wine :) We have a good time when we all get together. More people need to get married so we have excuses to do this stuff. Of course I ate too much, so when I got home I had more energy than my tiny body could contain. I put on some music and Buffy and I danced around for an hour and chased each other around the house. 13, hah! Buffy proves you're only as old as you feel... when her legs don't collapse from the arthritis. 

Friday I had planned to go shopping, 'cause hey, I'm in Bergen County, what else am I gonna do. I wasn't in the mood to shop though, so I wandered around the mall aimlessly until I rounded up enough courage to get my eyebrows threaded. I also got Natalie an awesome present for her second birthday party Sunday :) Oh and free frozen yogurt, but I told that story to Krissy and realized it wasn't very interesting, so I'll spare you. Then I went to party city and spent an hour there picking out a costume and then didn't buy it because it was too sexy for work. I came home and made myself a makeshift quesadilla for dinner and played castleville and watched How I Met Your Mother on Netflix for four hours. I had forgotten what it was like to feel bored. I picked Krissy up and then we got some much needed beauty sleep.

We woke up bright and early and rushed over to Carolyn's to get our hairs done. Rachi did my makeup and I played some wedding youtube music to keep Carolyn entertained :P Carolyn looked so pretty in her dress and sooooooo happy :D We took our fancy rides over to the church for the ceremony. Carolyn's Rolls-Royce honked Here Comes the Bride :D

The ceremony was nice, they did a good job with the music. We got to sit for most of it which was awesome. By the time we got to the reception hall my feet were dying. Thank God Carolyn got us flip flops! The cocktail hour was crazy! There's no way I could list the variety of food there. I didn't take too much because I knew there was more good stuff coming, but what I did have was delicious. And the drinks. The pumpkin martini, OMG.

The band had to have been the best wedding band ever. Seriously impressive. And I had just the right amount of alcohol, caffeine and sugar to get me up dancin' like a crazy little bridesmaid. Of course dinner was amazing. I had linguine with lobster and shrimp and clams :P The wedding cake was good. The chocolate covered strawberries were drool worthy. Ellen and Bryan were arguing about who would go over to the next table to steal their last strawberry, so I went over and took it for Bryan. 

The weather was so nice, the reception hall was beautiful and the couple obviously had the time of their life, as well as all the guests. It was a perfect day and the best wedding I've ever been to (except my own for obvious reasons :P).

What an awesome day! So sad it's over, but looking forward to seeing pictures and doing this all again next month for Rachi's wedding!

Also, for a fundraising event, we do the talent show every year. It was today and I was the last act. This meant I had a whole hour to freak myself out.

He has power, but no internet. My work has been closed. I assume they either have no power or no internet. We have a conference call in an hour. 
We packed up everything in our fridge yesterday and brought it here. Made pasta last night with our bison meat. Been eating a lot of protein our last three meals actually, lol. Can't let the meat go to waste. 
Monday was pretty fun before the power went out. I was working and skyping with my girlfriends. At 5 we decided to use Google hangouts since they let you do video chat with multiple people. They convinced me to open a bottle of wine. I had two glasses right before the power went out. That softened the blow a bit.

11/26/2012 21:54,11/27/2012 2:54,"Friday night, my bestest friend in the whole world got married! No surprise, I couldn't sleep Thursday night due to my excitement. The amazing Thanksgiving meal Bryan's mom made didn't help either. My body: why on earth would you eat all that food if we weren't going to run a marathon? I was also flipping out because there was a giant cyst on my chin threatening to make its way to the surface.

I woke up 6:30 Friday morning, exercised, did everything I could to shrink the zit. When I got to my parents, I took a short nap. Applied more green tea to the zit. Surprisingly, everything i did worked. Then I got a call from the hair place. They moved my appointment 45 minutes later. I ended up getting my hair and markup done after Krissy. She took forever. It was 2:40 by the time I got out and we had to be at the venue at 3.

We were like 7 minutes late and apparently everyone was already freaking out looking for me. We took pictures and hung out while we waited for the ceremony to start. Rachi looked beautiful. Her dress was absolutely perfect on her. The ceremony was outside, so we were freezing a little, but really it was so much warmer than it has been, so once again we lucked out with the weather.

Omg their vows. I just kept repeating, I'm not going to cry, I'm not going to cry, I don't think this makeup is waterproof, I'm not going to cry. Considering it's still on, it probably was waterproof, but I managed to hold back the tears.

After much difficulty bustling the dress, it was time for cocktail hour and cocktails we had. Probably a little too fast though. My body was all: woah, I haven't had anything in hours and now you're stuffing me with wine and fried goodness? I don't know how I feel about this. 

I'm glad I had the one drink before my speech though. Even with that I was shaking like a leaf. Public speaking is not my thing. Then came more food! Really good food. The salad was really good, but the salmon, wow. They put it in front of me and I'm like, how the hell am I supposed to eat all of this? But I di d.. Almost anyway. And dessert. Dude, their wedding cake was so dense and moist. And ice cream!

As good as the food was, we definitely had the most fun burning it off. Dancing is so much more fun with alcohol. Rachi gave me a shot :p even my parents danced a little. The highlight of the evening was the time warp. Good times. We spent the night laughing at Carolyn's endless supply of energy. Well, maybe if I had gotten a good night sleep and didn't exercise that morning, I too could have been an energizer bunny, but she was really quite impressive.

I was sad when it was all over :( such a good time. But I was also exhausted and a little nauseous. My parents drove me home and we picked up my car the next morning. It was all, aw, this was where the fun happened :( Carolyn and Rachi both need to get married again.",Rachi and Chris Are Married!,,,,,,

I told Bryan we had to do something fun this weekend. We went to Brian's yesterday and took Natalie to the Jump Zone. They have a bunch of those inflatable jumpy things there. Pretty amusing watching her run around screaming. She had a good time. She also enjoyed cleaning up after the other kids.

Wait... hmm, that wasn't the point of the program was it. I could have done much worse this week.

We had a free lunch on Monday for service anniversaries, but I only went up to the buffet once. I had cake, but it was really good cake. Tuesday was our EOY event that I organized, so I'm pretty sure even though I ate a lot, I burned it all off running around like a mad woman. I was also super stressed that day due to problems we were having in ST on top of having to deal with the party. That and when I brought my car in Monday, they told me the earliest appointment they could give me was 1/7 X( So I've been driving Bryan's car around all week trying not to break it, taking the long way home to avoid where I had the accident, still holding my breath when I have to make the left-hand turn off of 35.

My issues at work seem to have resolved themselves, but poor Jenny has a tough one she's working on this weekend :( I told her she can call me since, hell, I'm not doing anything, and whatever I can do to help makes everyone's lives easier... My code runs her code, so the sooner this gets resolved, the sooner ST can test and the sooner I can have a relaxing two week vacation :) More selfish than not.

Two weeks off and no car. Where would I go anyway? If we go see my friends or my parents, Bryan can drive. Can't go to the mall because people are insane about buying Christmas gifts. Can't you all just shop online like normal people? Why must you take my favorite hobby away from me??? I actually finished all my shopping- online. I spent a lot of time this year picking out gifts. I wanted to make every dollar count. I really hate buying a gift for the sake of buying a gift and it's a pretty good feeling when you find something really good. 

I don't think anything I bought was ""the perfect gift,"" but I'm pretty happy with all of my purchases and I think everyone will like what I got them. Well, I don't know if my dad will like his, but everyone will at least get a good laugh.

I get confused when people tell me they didn't know what to get me. I'm into every geeky franchise on the planet. That's why I love buying gifts for Rachelle. I Google Doctor Who or Tinkerbell and I'm done. I can't really think of a gift I've gotten that I didn't like... well, maybe some of the survival stuff my dad got us last year. If all hell breaks loose, we're screwed anyway. And there was that year Andrew got us all those head massaging thingies that just messed up our hair. His heart was in the right place.

I've gotten some really great gifts. There are things that I've gotten from my wishlist or registry that I obviously wanted and are loved. Though when I put the ice cream maker on our registry I thought, hah, like I'll ever use that. :) Then there are gifts I wanted, but never expected to get like my Tyco Video Cam or every episode of Farscape ever. I also greatly appreciate the things I would never think to buy for myself, but I end up using all the time, mostly clothes. Presies are fun like that.",The Art of Gift Giving,,,,,,

Wait... hmm, that wasn't the point of the program was it. I could have done much worse this week.

We had a free lunch on Monday for service anniversaries, but I only went up to the buffet once. I had cake, but it was really good cake. Tuesday was our EOY event that I organized, so I'm pretty sure even though I ate a lot, I burned it all off running around like a mad woman. I was also super stressed that day due to problems we were having in ST on top of having to deal with the party. That and when I brought my car in Monday, they told me the earliest appointment they could give me was 1/7 X( So I've been driving Bryan's car around all week trying not to break it, taking the long way home to avoid where I had the accident, still holding my breath when I have to make the left-hand turn off of 35.

My issues at work seem to have resolved themselves, but poor Jenny has a tough one she's working on this weekend :( I told her she can call me since, hell, I'm not doing anything, and whatever I can do to help makes everyone's lives easier... My code runs her code, so the sooner this gets resolved, the sooner ST can test and the sooner I can have a relaxing two week vacation :) More selfish than not.

I've been off work since last Tuesday afternoon. Bryan and I saw the hobbit Wednesday morning so we could get the little old lady price of $6 a ticket. Being unemployed has its benefits. It was better than I thought it would be, though like the other movies, frelling long. I didn't fall asleep though, that's how I know it was good. You'd think I have low standards but I've fallen asleep during a cirque du soleil show and a broadway show before.

Spent the rest of the week watching Dexter, playing You Don't Know Jack, cleaning... Saturday we went to Ellen's birthday at this adorable Mexican restaurant. The food was good and the drinks made us very silly. We had a good time.

I stayed at my parents and came back with them on Tuesday for Christmas. Everyone came to our place again and brought enough food to feed us five times over. Son good though. Especially Lyn's lasagne. There wasn't much of that leftover. I made spaghetti squash. There was a lot of that left. 

Ah dessert. The best part. While my ice cream was a hit, Lyn's cheesecake was quite possibly the best cheesecake ever. Why is homemade cheesecake always so much better? There was also peppermint cake and cookies which we still have in our house so I can expect to go back to work about five pounds heavier.

Though I have my new fitbit. It's a glorified pedometer that syncs with my iPad and can sleep too. It's a neat little gadget. We also got the slow cooker as on my wishlist, some Doctor Who items, a robe, comfy long underwear that I'm wearing right now :) pretty ornaments, Mickey earrings and a necklace, lots of bath goodies. I finally got the thing for the car to play music and talk on the phone through the radio, but as you know, my car is out of commission for a little while longer. 

I should have asked for gloves. I lost one I think at the body shop when I was there for my estimate. I should call them to see. This is me being lazy. I should do a lot of things. Oh well, I vacuumed, that's enough.",Christmas,,,,,,
1/17/2013 9:23,1/17/2013 14:23,"I finally saw Looper this past weekend. I really love stories about time travel, even when they don't make sense at all, like Looper. I was OK with most of the movie. Like every other time travel movie, they set up rules and break them constantly. That's forgivable. The ending was not. While a cool concept, it turned the movie into one gigantic paradox. They acted like in his timeline Joe had always come back to the past and fucked things up, but we know that's not true because we saw that didn't happen in his original timeline in the beginning of the movie. Had they not shown us his original timeline it would have been a big stretch, but at least slightly more believable.  The movie obviously had other issues, but that one bugged the hell out of me. 

I still haven't gotten my car back from the body shop. Yes, it's been a month and a half. It was supposed to be done a week ago. I swear it was just a little fender bender. I really miss my car. Bryan's car is not made for a short person and I'm spending way more on gas than usual. 

<a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a> has been fun these past two weeks. Circuit workouts seem to go by very quickly. I especially like the core workout. Everyone complains about the scorpions, but once I realized I was doing twice as many as the plan said to do, it was a good time. I'm excited to see what the workout will be for the week we're in Disney. Hope it's doable at the gym there. It's a really nice gym, but a little small and the people are a bit intimidating. These are only the people who are really serious about working out because if you're not dedicated, you're not going to the gym on vacation. Most of the people there last year were these really big guys and I'm like, hi, yeah, excuse me, trying to get to the ten pound weights... I'm hoping it will be a little less crowded since it's not right after New Years.

Aaaaah Disney! I can't wait! Trip number 18!!!! So soon, yet so far away.... Less than a month. Want to start packing now!!!! ",Still Carless,,,,,,

",A Look Back at 2012,,,,,,
12/31/2012 10:45,12/31/2012 15:45,"Every year before the new year begins, I look back at past recorded years. Earlier entries have been edited for length. Current yearâs at the bottom if you want to skip to that.
<!--more-->

1996-1997:
Happy new yearâs eve. Iâm going to Jenâs house. We are eating at the Crab Shack. I was off from school.
My new yearâs resolution is to try to take a shower every day!
I was off from school, but Iâm going back tomorrow.

1997-1998:
HAPPY NEW YEAR! On nick and the Big Ball!! Letâs take a look at last yearâs New Year:
Last yearâs resolution was to take a shower every day! I did that starting in September. This year I have a few resolutions:
#1: eat less candy. #2: Wear my hair in pigtails. #3: Get straight Aâs on my report card. #4: Go to bed at the time I should. #5: Keep my room clean. Itâs a lot, but I can do it. Well the straight As thing, only counts for mp III and IIII. Stay on the Principalâs list. thatâs easier. see ya next year! I can play âAuld Land Syneâ on my keyboard. Goodbye 1997! Hello 98!! Happy New Year!!

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

We watched video from the Halloween party and Andrew running into the poleâ¦ twice, lmao, then Austin Powers in Goldmember, Jeckyll and Hyde, Back to the Future!! and begining of The Others. We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Floriday three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn&#039;t have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents&#039;. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian&#039;s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She&#039;s a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&#039;s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn&#039;t have a mortgage then. As long as we don&#039;t go crazy buying shit we don&#039;t need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.",New Year's Past,,,,,,

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae's birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I've read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Floriday three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn't have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian's and my parents'. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian's daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She's a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle's weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I've been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I've been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I've been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I'm making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn't have a mortgage then. As long as we don't go crazy buying shit we don't need we should be OK.",New Year's Past,,,,,,

An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis.

This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding.

K, itâs 2002 now!! Itâs been a very interesting night. My parents were late for the party, yeah, I was here before them. And Rachel beat me at Mario Party (though I beat her later on Now sheâs serving me (pretend) ice cream and Ethan just gave me a plastic egg, make that two, lol.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!
The next day:
Well, Happy New Year everyone! Mesa had lotsa fun at party last nightâ¦ âTwas me, Kristin, Cara, and Rachelle. We watched video from the Halloween party and Andrew running into the poleâ¦ twice, lmao, then Austin Powers in Goldmember, Jeckyll and Hyde, Back to the Future!! and begining of The Others. We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Floriday three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn&#039;t have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents&#039;. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian&#039;s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She&#039;s a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&#039;s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn&#039;t have a mortgage then. As long as we don&#039;t go crazy buying shit we don&#039;t need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of ",New Year's Past,,,,,,
12/31/2012 10:46,12/31/2012 15:46,"Every year before the new year begins, I look back at past recorded years. Earlier entries have been edited for length. Current yearâs at the bottom if you want to skip to that.

The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&#039;s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn&#039;t have a mortgage then. As long as we don&#039;t go crazy buying shit we don&#039;t need we should be OK.",New Year's Past,,,,,,

It worked really well, but I guess I should have waited for them to cool off more before mixing them with the ice cream, because not only did the ice cream melt, it formed these gigantic smore chunks you could break your tooth on.

2/11/2013 18:32,2/11/2013 23:32,"This was probably our best trip ever. The weather was perfect. 70s and sunny all week. Meanwhile there was a snowstorm back home. It also wasn't too crowded with the exception of Monday when we purposely went to the ""wrong"" park. 
<!--more-->

I kept up with the <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a>, though I did the minimum since we were walking so much. We averaged 20,000-30,000 steps a day.

Saturday we arrived late in the afternoon. We went over to downtown Disney where I bought my steampunk Mickey ears that I blogged about a while back. We got my dad the Tables in Wonderland card which is $100, but you get 20% off of almost all the restaurants. 

We ate dinner at Fulton's Crab House. My dad and Bryan definitely ordered the wrong thing. They ended up with a bunch of deep fried stuff. My mom and I shared the crab cakes and lobster ravioli and they were both delicious. The service was terrible. Our waiter kept disappearing. He was half way through taking our order and oops, brb. It was bizarre.

Sunday we went to the Animal Kingdom. We got there pretty much when it opened. Lunch was at Yak and Yeti as usual. The seafood curry wasn't nearly as good as the last few times though. Too salty. Everest was just as awesome as always. I told Bryan we had to make the not impressed face on Dinosaur. Only photo we bought this trip. We had dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

Monday I had planned for us to go to Epcot, but we found out Bryan's family was in Disney too and his step sister was going to the Magic Kingdom that day and also the MVP was going to be in the parade, so we changed it to a Magic Kingdom day. We got there at rope drop and went to Enchanted Tales With Bell first thing as there's no fast pass for it so the queue gets long quickly. It was cute, but definitely would not have been worth an hour wait.

It was a good thing we decided to do MK that day since we saw not only Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but Rabbit! Rabbit is pretty rare and even the cast member with him was excited to see him.

We met up with Bryan's step sister around 12 and did all the big rides. Except Splash Mountin because it was closed :( We sort of saw the MVP and had some ""souper"" bowls of soup that were most definitely not super.

We had dinner with his step sister and her husband at Wolfgang Puck. I was smart and ordered pizza this time. 

Tuesday we went to MK again and did everything we didn't do Monday. We had lunch at Liberty Tree which was my second favorite meal of the whole trip. My veggie burger and the toffee cake, omg. 

Bryan got picked as Randall on the Laugh Floor and did a great job at being invisible. I was in tears from laughter. The Jungle Cruise was not as funny. I got the highest score possible on Buzz, but that just means it was broken.

Dinner was at Be Our Guest restaurant. Our reservation was for 6:45, we had our check by 7:07 and this was after dessert. Our waitress really wanted us out of there. Bryan was only like half way through his meal when she brought out the dessert tray. He wanted another dessert, and my parents wanted coffee, but never got the opportunity to ask. Otherwise, the restaurant was pretty amazing and the food was good.

We saw most of the new projection show before Wishes, that was pretty neat. My parents left back for the resort before the fireworks started, but we still ended up on the same bus back with them.

Wednesday we headed to Hollywood studios. Ate breakfast at Rolling Stars Cafe, lunch at SciFi. My burger and drink were both delicious. Had to ditch my parents a little early for our Rockin Rollercoaster fast passes. Went on Star Tours three times, I was the rebel spy once :) For some reason, during the Indiana Jones Stunt Show, the German guy was shot instead of getting killed by the plane's propellers. Bryan finally got to see Fantasmic.

We had dinner at Il Mulino again. Yes, there's one in NY, but the one at the Swan is so much more convenient to get to ;) My mom and I shared and I took some food back to the room for breakfast.

Thursday we finally went to Epcot. I say finally because usually it's the first or second park we visit. Again, we got there early and managed to do almost all we wanted to before 4pm. The new Test Track was terrible. When it's functioning properly, it's probably great, but they were having technical difficulties and it kept stopping really short. There's a part of the ride where the car stops short as a truck is about to hit it, but these unscheduled stops were much harder and not pleasant. We didn't enjoy the ride much. 

We thought we had our picture with Snow Prince, but turns out he's the only prince we didn't have. Until now.

We had dinner at Jiko at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Braised Short Ribs. Wow. Wow. But the meal took a while and we had to meet Katie and Rachael for dessert at Beaches, so we skipped out a little early, got the bus to Hollywood Studios and sprinted over to the Beach Club. Took us 30 minutes total because we're awesome like that.

Friday was Sea World for the first time since '97 for me and '90 for Bryan. We met up with my dad's cousin, Donna there. They have roller coasters now, really good ones, but less fish. We came for the fish, so we were a bit disappointed. And no penguins because they're still working on the new Penguin attraction :( I did enjoy the walrus though that responded when Donna waved at him. That was entertaining. The shows were pretty good too.

We ate dinner at The House of Blues. Very yummy ribs and flatbread, but the dessert, the bread pudding, was my second favorite of the trip.

Saturday we went back to EPCOT to do the Vision House and other little things we didn't get to the other day. We ate lunch at Via Napoli. Sad to say, not as good at the pizza in Naples. Bryan's got the $14 sundae which was not worth $14. Bryan had almost the same thing at the Yacht Club at dinner and it was only $9 there. 

We walked around World Showcase for a while and oh yeah, saw this guy:

Good trip for rare characters. We left Epcot early and chilled in the room before dinner. Dinner was at Yachtsman. The bread and garlic was delicious as usual. Only my dad ordered steak. I got the butternut squash ravioli. Our waiter said the chef from Cali Grill was working there while it was being refurbished and it was his dish, so I had to have it. It was small, only three ravioli, but delicious. That just meant I had room for the amazing peanut butter cake dessert. So good. Third favorite dessert of the trip. Maybe tied for second.

Sunday morning we packed and had breakfast at Kouzina. We had a late flight, so we had some time to kill. We did the difficult fairways course at Fantasia mini golf. I managed to get a hole in one on one of the holes. Bryan says it's because I'm talented, but all my sixes on the other holes say otherwise. We had ice cream at The Fountain at The Dolphin afterwards. Last ice cream of the trip :( So sad to go back home. It was a really great trip. At least I got to wear my new Minnie jacket and Figment hat today. Really wish I was still in Florida.",Disney World 2013,,,,,,
1/9/2013 21:40,1/10/2013 2:40,"I've been reading the book What Alice Forgot as part of <a href=""http://www.pbfingers.com/2013/01/07/what-alice-forgot/"">Peanut Butter Fingers' book club</a>. The story is about a woman who falls and hits her head while exercising and loses the last ten years of her life including all memory of her three children and her impending divorce. I thought, what would happen if I fell over and lost the last ten years of memories?

I'd wake up in my basement having no idea where I was. Probably yell out for help. Hopefully Bryan would be sleeping on the couch and come in to see what the fuss was. I'd start crying and ask him who he was and why he kidnapped me while catching a glimpse of myself in the mirror. I'd scream and wonder how long I was out and why my kidnapper didn't feed me. Golly I lost a lot of weight, but look pretty good for someone malnourished.

Bryan would explain that he isn't my kidnapper, but my husband. Pretty surprising considering I've never even been on a date. He'd conclude I must have hit my head while exercising, which is also surprising because why on earth would I exercise voluntarily. He'd call 911 and the paramedics would take me to the nearest hospital.

My parents would rush over and would confirm that Bryan is indeed my husband, but that I could go home with them if I wanted. They'd show me pictures of my wedding and I'd be pretty happy with my dress (and my figure) and well as my choice of bridesmaids. Except the one, who's she? 

At some point someone would notify work and everyone would be calling and texting me. OMG my phone is so cool! I work at AT&amp;T?? Nice! Of course I have a cool phone. I'm a Programmer? Well, that's not news. I still blog at silvercpu? Somethings never change....",What Lissy Forgot,,,,,,

I'd wake up in my basement having no idea where I was. Probably yell out for help. Hopefully Bryan would be sleeping on the couch and come in to see what the fuss was.

Golly I lost a lot of weight, but look pretty good for someone malnourished.

Bryan would explain that he isn't my kidnapper, but my husband. Pretty surprising considering I've never even been on a date. He'd conclude I must have hit my head while exercising, which is also surprising because why on earth would I exercise voluntarily. Hopefully he would call 911 and the paramedics would take me to the nearest hospital.

Like every other time travel movie, they set up rules and break them constantly creating paradox after paradox. That's forgivable, but the ending was not. While a cool concept, it turned the movie into one gigantic paradox. Either you go with the multiverse thing or you stick to one timeline, you can't have it both ways and you certainly can't have it both ways simultaneously. And I hate hate hate when characters explain time travel by saying something like ""don't think about it, it'll give you a headache"" or ""it's time travel, don't try to explain it."" If you were doing it right, you'd be able to explain it. Obviously Joe has no qualms about unraveling the space-time continuum and destroying the entire universe. Back to the Future isn't perfect either, but the only unforgivable act in that movie was Marty's fading away and that was for dramatic effect, so I'll let it slide. I enjoyed Looper, I really did, but the ending bugged the hell out of me.

I still haven't gotten my car back from the body shop. Yes, it's been a month and a half. It was supposed to be done a week ago. I swear it was just a little fender bender. I really miss my car. Bryan's car is not made for a short person and I'm spending way more on gas than usual.

3/9/2013 16:13,3/9/2013 21:13,"I finished re-watching Felicity today. Let me first talk about the series minus the final episode. It's amazing how much more I appreciate it now. Maybe I just had forgotten how much I liked it, or maybe after going through high school and college I can understand the characters better.

If you ever plan on watching the series in the future, I would stop reading here as there are spoilers ahead.

I was so angry at Felicity for sleeping with the art guy originally. I had always wanted her to be with Noel. This time, I was routing for Ben. Maybe because I knew she'd end up with him and I wanted a happy ending.

The final few episodes have some terrible reviews, but I kinda loved the time travel thing, and the Twilight Zone episode as well. While Felicity is not at all a SciFi show, I liked how they made it pretty realistic. Obviously in real life, someone would stick her in a mental institution and that's what they did.

But the finale makes no sense at all. The problem is, even if Felicity really did travel back in time and she actually managed to warn Elena, none of her other actions had any effect on the future at all. We know this because Noel is still alive. 

I was reading reviews online hoping that ten years later someone can offer up an explanation as to how Elena was still alive. 

<a href=""http://www.oocities.org/felicityseasons/timeline.htm"">This is the only plausible explanation I could find</a>. Basically it says that Felicity warned Elena after the spell to bring her back to the future, so all actions she made in the past were erased except that one. However, there is nothing in the episode that even hints at this since the scene where Felicity warns her was left out. Biggest TV fail ever. Well, except for JJs endings to Alias and Lost... Those were worse.",When Will JJ End a Show Properly?,,,,,,

Seriously, those of you who actually go to a gym to workout every day, wow. It's so incredibly inconvenient. Even though we have a gym in our building at work, the logistics of the whole thing were just such a pain. 

Packing my gym bag the night before: this took like an hour because I couldn't decide what clothes would fit in my bag and go well with sneakers because I didn't want to carry a second pair of shoes.
Going to work in my workout clothes: and I hadn't showered yet so I looked, well, like I was going to the gym.
The awkwardness: How does this machine work? Oh, ok, it's moving. Oh, this TV is fuzzy and wow they did an awful job with the captions. Wish I had Netflix here. OK, now I have to wipe down the machine so people don't think I'm disgusting. Weights, great, there are big annoying dudes doing weights and grunting. And of course I'm falling over while doing the single leg deadlifts. Yeah, I'll go stretch in the locker room now. The only good part of that experience is that I knew exactly what exercises I was doing thanks to Tina's <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a>. 
Showering: I made such a mess you wouldn't believe it. You'd think I never showered before. I made the mistake of bringing the bag with my soap into the shower with me. The bag of course filled with water. By the time I was done, all of my stuff was wet and the two benches that all of my stuff was covering. At least there was no one else in the locker room to see that. I'm not even going to get into changing in front of strangers or seeing other women walking around naked since that was a non-issue on this trip, but if there are other people there, it's a thing.
Lugging all my crap back to my office with dripping wet hair: Yes I realize I could blow dry my hair, but my hair tends to have static issues when I blow dry it, so that wasn't going to happen.
Makeup: Didn't even bother.
Laundry: And yeah, now I gotta wash all my soaking wet clothes and towel.

I'm sure I would fall into some sort of routine if I went to the gym every day, but when it comes down to it, it's so much easier and more pleasant to workout at home, especially when the gym at work really doesn't have much better equipment.",Going to the Gym,,,,,,

<!--more-->

I kept up with the <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a>, though I did the minimum since we were walking so much. We averaged 20,000-30,000 steps a day.

Saturday we arrived late in the afternoon. We went over to downtown Disney where I bought my steampunk Mickey ears that I blogged about a while back. We got my dad the Tables in Wonderland card which is $100, but you get 20% off of almost all the restaurants. 

We ate dinner at Fulton's Crab House. My dad and Bryan definitely ordered the wrong thing. They ended up with a bunch of deep fried stuff. My mom and I shared the crab cakes and lobster ravioli and they were both delicious. The service was terrible. Our waiter kept disappearing. He was half way through taking our order and oops, brb. It was bizarre.

Sunday we went to the Animal Kingdom. We got there pretty much when it opened. Lunch was at Yak and Yeti as usual. The seafood curry wasn't nearly as good as the last few times though. Too salty. Everest was just as awesome as always. I told Bryan we had to make the not impressed face on Dinosaur. Only photo we bought this trip. We had dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

Monday I had planned for us to go to Epcot, but we found out Bryan's family was in Disney too and his step sister was going to the Magic Kingdom that day and also the MVP was going to be in the parade, so we changed it to a Magic Kingdom day. We got there at rope drop and went to Enchanted Tales With Bell first thing as there's no fast pass for it so the queue gets long quickly. It was cute, but definitely would not have been worth an hour wait.

It was a good thing we decided to do MK that day since we saw not only Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but Rabbit! Rabbit is pretty rare and even the cast member with him was excited to see him.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/405652_10102340425350719_2114107760_n.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/405652_10102340425350719_2114107760_n.jpg"" alt=""405652_10102340425350719_2114107760_n"" width=""960"" height=""640"" class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-3931"" /></a>

We met up with Bryan's step sister around 12 and did all the big rides. Except Splash Mountin because it was closed :( We sort of saw the MVP and had some ""souper"" bowls of soup that were most definitely not super.

We had dinner with his step sister and her husband at Wolfgang Puck. I was smart and ordered pizza this time. 

Tuesday we went to MK again and did everything we didn't do Monday. We had lunch at Liberty Tree which was my second favorite meal of the whole trip. My veggie burger and the toffee cake, omg. 

Bryan got picked as Randall on the Laugh Floor and did a great job at being invisible. I was in tears from laughter. The Jungle Cruise was not as funny. I got the highest score possible on Buzz, but that just means it was broken.

Dinner was at Be Our Guest restaurant. Our reservation was for 6:45, we had our check by 7:07 and this was after dessert. Our waitress really wanted us out of there. Bryan was only like half way through his meal when she brought out the dessert tray. He wanted another dessert, and my parents wanted coffee, but never got the opportunity to ask. Otherwise, the restaurant was pretty amazing and the food was good.

We saw most of the new projection show before Wishes, that was pretty neat. My parents left back for the resort before the fireworks started, but we still ended up on the same bus back with them.

Wednesday we headed to Hollywood studios. Ate breakfast at Rolling Stars Cafe, lunch at SciFi. My burger and drink were both delicious. Had to ditch my parents a little early for our Rockin Rollercoaster fast passes. Went on Star Tours three times, I was the rebel spy once :) For some reason, during the Indiana Jones Stunt Show, the German guy was shot instead of getting killed by the plane's propellers. Bryan finally got to see Fantasmic.

We had dinner at Il Mulino again. Yes, there's one in NY, but the one at the Swan is so much more convenient to get to ;) My mom and I shared and I took some food back to the room for breakfast.

Thursday we finally went to Epcot. I say finally because usually it's the first or second park we visit. Again, we got there early and managed to do almost all we wanted to before 4pm. The new Test Track was terrible. When it's functioning properly, it's probably great, but they were having technical difficulties and it kept stopping really short. There's a part of the ride where the car stops short as a truck is about to hit it, but these unscheduled stops were much harder and not pleasant. We didn't enjoy the ride much. 

We thought we had our picture with Snow Prince, but turns out he's the only prince we didn't have. Until now.

We had dinner at Jiko at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Braised Short Ribs. Wow. Wow. But the meal took a while and we had to meet Katie and Rachael for dessert at Beaches, so we skipped out a little early, got the bus to Hollywood Studios and sprinted over to the Beach Club. Took us 30 minutes total because we're awesome like that.

Friday was Sea World for the first time since '97 for me and '90 for Bryan. We met up with my dad's cousin, Donna there. They have roller coasters now, really good ones, but less fish. We came for the fish, so we were a bit disappointed. And no penguins because they're still working on the new Penguin attraction :( I did enjoy the walrus though that responded when Donna waved at him. That was entertaining. The shows were pretty good too.

We ate dinner at The House of Blues. Very yummy ribs and flatbread, but the dessert, the bread pudding, was my second favorite of the trip.

Saturday we went back to EPCOT to do the Vision House and other little things we didn't get to the other day. We ate lunch at Via Napoli. Sad to say, not as good at the pizza in Naples. Bryan's got the $14 sundae which was not worth $14. Bryan had almost the same thing at the Yacht Club at dinner and it was only $9 there. 

We walked around World Showcase for a while and oh yeah, saw this guy:

Good trip for rare characters. We left Epcot early and chilled in the room before dinner. Dinner was at Yachtsman. The bread and garlic was delicious as usual. Only my dad ordered steak. I got the butternut squash ravioli. Our waiter said the chef from Cali Grill was working there while it was being refurbished and it was his dish, so I had to have it. It was small, only three ravioli, but delicious. That just meant I had room for the amazing peanut butter cake dessert. So good. Third favorite dessert of the trip. Maybe tied for second.

Sunday morning we packed and had breakfast at Kouzina. We had a late flight, so we had some time to kill. We did the difficult fairways course at Fantasia mini golf. I managed to get a hole in one on one of the holes. Bryan says it's because I'm talented, but all my sixes on the other holes say otherwise. We had ice cream at The Fountain at The Dolphin afterwards. Last ice cream of the trip :( So sad to go back home. It was a really great trip. At least I got to wear my new Minnie jacket and Figment hat today. Really wish I was still in Florida.",Disney World 2013,,,,,,

2/11/2013 18:32,2/11/2013 23:32,"This was probably our best trip ever. The weather was perfect. 70s and sunny all week. Meanwhile there was a snowstorm back home. It also wasn't too crowded with the exception of Monday when we purposely went to the ""wrong"" park. 

I kept up with the Best Body Bootcamp, though I did the minimum since we were walking so much. We averaged 20,000-30,000 steps a day.

Saturday we arrived late in the afternoon. We went over to downtown Disney where I bought my steampunk Mickey ears that I blogged about a while back. We got my dad the Tables in Wonderland card which is $100, but you get 20% off of almost all the restaurants. 

We ate dinner at Fulton's Crab House. My dad and Bryan definitely ordered the wrong thing. They ended up with a bunch of deep fried stuff. My mom and I shared the crab cakes and lobster ravioli and they were both delicious. The service was terrible. Our waiter kept disappearing. He was half way through taking our order and oops, brb. It was bizarre.

Sunday we went to the Animal Kingdom. We got there pretty much when it opened. Lunch was at Yak and Yeti as usual. The seafood curry wasn't nearly as good as the last few times though. Too salty. Everest was just as awesome as always. I told Bryan we had to make the not impressed face on Dinosaur. Only photo we bought this trip. We had dinner at Boma at the Animal Kingdom Lodge.

Monday I had planned for us to go to Epcot, but we found out Bryan's family was in Disney too and his step sister was going to the Magic Kingdom that day and also the MVP was going to be in the parade, so we changed it to a Magic Kingdom day. We got there at rope drop and went to Enchanted Tales With Bell first thing as there's no fast pass for it so the queue gets long quickly. It was cute, but definitely would not have been worth an hour wait.

It was a good thing we decided to do MK that day since we saw not only Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but Rabbit! Rabbit is pretty rare and even the cast member with him was excited to see him.

We met up with Bryan's step sister around 12 and did all the big rides. Except Splash Mountin because it was closed :( We sort of saw the MVP and had some ""souper"" bowls of soup that were most definitely not super. 

We had dinner with his step sister and her husband at Wolfgang Puck. I was smart and ordered pizza this time. 

Tuesday we went to MK again and did everything we didn't do Monday. We had lunch at Liberty Tree which was my second favorite meal of the whole trip. My veggie burger and the toffee cake, omg. 

Bryan got picked as Randall on the Laugh Floor and did a great job at being invisible. I was in tears from laughter. The Jungle Cruise was not as funny.

Dinner was at Be Our Guest restaurant. Our reservation was for 6:45, we had our check by 7:07 and this was after dessert. Our waitress really wanted us out of there. Bryan was only like half way through his meal when she brought out the dessert tray. He wanted another dessert, and my parents wanted coffee, but never got the opportunity to ask. Otherwise, the restaurant was pretty amazing and the food was good.

We saw most of the new projection show before Wishes, that was pretty neat. My parents left back for the resort before the fireworks started, but we still ended up on the same bus back with them.

Wednesday we headed to Hollywood studios. Ate breakfast at Rolling Stars Cafe, lunch at SciFi. My burger and drink were both delicious. Had to ditch my parents a little early for our Rockin Rollercoaster fast passes. Went on Star Tours three times, I was the rebel spy once :)

We had dinner at Il Mulino again. Yes, there's one in NY, but the one at the Swan is so much more convenient to get to ;) My mom and I shared and I took some food back to the room for breakfast.

Thursday we finally went to Epcot. I say finally because usually it's the first or second park we visit. Again, we got there early and managed to do almost all we wanted to before 4pm. The new Test Track was terrible. When it's functioning properly, it's probably great, but they were having technical difficulties and it kept stopping really short. There's a part of the ride where the car stops short as a truck is about to hit it, but these unscheduled stops were much harder and not pleasant. We didn't enjoy the ride much.

We had dinner with his step sister and her husband at Wolfgang Puck. I was smart and ordered pizza this time. 

Tuesday we went to MK again and did everything we didn't do Monday. We had lunch at Liberty Tree which was my second favorite meal of the whole trip. My veggie burger and the toffee cake, omg. 

Bryan got picked as Randall on the Laugh Floor and did a great job at being invisible. I was in tears from laughter. The Jungle Cruise was not as funny. I got the highest score possible on Buzz, but that just means it was broken.

Dinner was at Be Our Guest restaurant. Our reservation was for 6:45, we had our check by 7:07 and this was after dessert. Our waitress really wanted us out of there. Bryan was only like half way through his meal when she brought out the dessert tray. He wanted another dessert, and my parents wanted coffee, but never got the opportunity to ask. Otherwise, the restaurant was pretty amazing and the food was good.

We saw most of the new projection show before Wishes, that was pretty neat. My parents left back for the resort before the fireworks started, but we still ended up on the same bus back with them.

Wednesday we headed to Hollywood studios. Ate breakfast at Rolling Stars Cafe, lunch at SciFi. My burger and drink were both delicious. Had to ditch my parents a little early for our Rockin Rollercoaster fast passes. Went on Star Tours three times, I was the rebel spy once :) For some reason, during the Indiana Jones Stunt Show, the German guy was shot instead of getting killed by the plane's propellers. Bryan finally got to see Fantasmic.

We had dinner at Il Mulino again. Yes, there's one in NY, but the one at the Swan is so much more convenient to get to ;) My mom and I shared and I took some food back to the room for breakfast.

Thursday we finally went to Epcot. I say finally because usually it's the first or second park we visit. Again, we got there early and managed to do almost all we wanted to before 4pm. The new Test Track was terrible. When it's functioning properly, it's probably great, but they were having technical difficulties and it kept stopping really short. There's a part of the ride where the car stops short as a truck is about to hit it, but these unscheduled stops were much harder and not pleasant. We didn't enjoy the ride much. 

We thought we had our picture with Snow Prince, but turns out he's the only prince we didn't have. Until now.

We had dinner at Jiko at the Animal Kingdom Lodge. Definitely my favorite meal of the trip. Braised Short Ribs. Wow. Wow. But the meal took a while and we had to meet Katie and Rachael for dessert at Beaches, so we skipped out a little early, got the bus to Hollywood Studios and sprinted over to the Beach Club. Took us 30 minutes total because we're awesome like that.

Friday was Sea World for the first time since '97 for me and '90 for Bryan. We met up with my dad's cousin, Donna there. They have roller coasters now, really good ones, but less fish. We came for the fish, so we were a bit disappointed. And no penguins because they're still working on the new Penguin attraction :( I did enjoy the walrus though that responded when Donna waved at him. That was entertaining. The shows were pretty good too.

We ate dinner at The House of Blues. Very yummy ribs and flatbread, but the dessert, the bread pudding, was my second favorite of the trip.

Saturday we went back to EPCOT to do the Vision House and other little things we didn't get to the other day. We ate lunch at Via Napoli. Sad to say, not as good at the pizza in Naples. Bryan's got the $14 sundae which was not worth $14. Bryan had almost the same thing at the Yacht Club at dinner and it was only $9 there. 

We walked around World Showcase for a while and oh yeah, saw this guy:

Good trip for rare characters. We left Epcot early and chilled in the room before dinner. Dinner was at Yachtsman. The bread and garlic was delicious as usual. Only my dad ordered steak. I got the butternut squash ravioli. Our waiter said the chef from Cali Grill was working there while it was being refurbished and it was his dish, so I had to have it. It was small, only three ravioli, but delicious. That just meant I had room for the amazing peanut butter cake dessert. So good. Third favorite dessert of the trip. Maybe tied for second.

Sunday morning we packed and had breakfast at Kouzina. We had a late flight, so we had some time to kill. We did the difficult fairways course at Fantasia mini golf. I managed to get a hole in one on one of the holes. Bryan says it's because I'm talented, but all my sixes on the other holes say otherwise. We had ice cream at The Fountain at The Dolphin afterwards. Last ice cream of the trip :( So sad to go back home. It was a really great trip. At least I got to wear my new Minnie jacket and Figment hat today. Really wish I was still in Florida.",Disney World 2013,,,,,,

Bryan's been painting the red room any color but red :P I picked a nice, desaturated blue. I like it. That'll probably be the guest room ... once we buy a bed to go in there. And then the sea green room with by our future child's room. Sadly, at some point, I'll have to stop using the room as a large walk-in closet.

Last night Bryan and I were discussing the logistics of planning a vacation during the year I'm pregnant. It's inevitable. We got to Disney every year, eventually we're gonna have a baby, you spend 9 months pregnant, it's going to be a problem. Either I won't be able to fly, I'll be able to fly, but won't be able to go on any rides, or we'll have a newborn and won't be able to leave the house. It's a sacrifice we're willing to make.

I still think the odds are in our favor for a Back to the Future baby. My dad was born in '55, me in '85, we only need 2015 to complete the trilogy.

This week's Bryan's facebook account was disabled for no reason and then enabled again. And facebook suggested I check out a new diet plan to lose weight :-/ Those suggested posts are getting really annoying. Actually, many real posts are getting annoying too. I can't stand all the political crap. The election's been over for a long time now, stop with the stupid anti-Obama stuff already! Intelligent political posts I can handle, but really, a graphic with the president on it claiming that he screwed us all over - not helping your cause. And there's plenty of stuff from the other side too. Facebook is not a soapbox. Really, I'd much rather see what you ate for lunch. I give Facebook another five years. It has most definitely already jumped the shark. 

Another thing I've noticed getting really bad lately: drivers. People can't fucking drive. Especially on weekends. Do people look when they're making turns anymore? Actually, I feel like they do look, they see me, and then decide I'll stop, so they'll turn anyway. And the amount of people we've seen who can't stay in their lane... they'll literally drive on the line. So many people I know have been in accidents this past year. Stop fiddling with your cell phones, stop weaving in and out of lanes, actually just stop driving because there's too many cars in New Jersey. 

I couldn't believe how long it took me to get to Rutgers and back this week. Last time I went for interviewing it took me maybe 35 minutes with traffic. 50 minutes to get there and back. The campus is only 20 minutes away. And it's not just that there's too many cars, no one wants to stay in their lane. Pick a lane and stick to it. You know rt18 is to the left, rt1 is to the right, there's no reason to be going back and forth.

Yay Rachi and Chris' Doctor Who housewarming party tonight! I made blueberry custard TARDIS ice cream. It's more purple than blue, but still a lot better than the bright violet it was before adding the custard last night. This morning I learned that acid turns blueberries red.

Maybe I just had forgotten how much I liked it, or maybe after going through high school and college I can understand the characters better.

If you ever plan on watching the series in the future, I would stop reading here as there are spoilers ahead.

I was so angry at Felicity for sleeping with the art guy originally. I had always wanted her to be with Noel. This time, I was routing for Ben. Maybe because I knew she'd end up with him and I wanted a happy ending.

The final few episodes have some terrible reviews, but I kinda loved the time travel thing, and the Twilight Zone episode as well. While Felicity is not at all a SciFi show, I liked how they made it pretty realistic. Obviously in real life, someone would stick her in a mental institution and that's what they did.

But the finale makes no sense at all. The problem is, even if Felicity really did travel back in time and she actually managed to warn Elena, none of her other actions had any effect on the future at all. We know this because Noel is still alive. 



<a href=""http://www.oocities.org/felicityseasons/timeline.htm"">This is the only plausible explanation I could find</a>. Basically it says that Felicity warned Elena after the spell to bring her back to the future, so all actions she made in the past were erased except that one.

My boring description of Monday, 3/18/2013

<!--more-->

5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of your breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicates. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one of the cardio workouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while. Of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, but you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. Taht'll be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Someone locked Maryam's laptop in the empty office. She and Nitika had to go down to security to free it :D Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg""><img title=""20130318_114204.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg"" /></a> 

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (you have a Rutgers mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son was 2010. Nitika is the ""a"" and ""um"" counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ""ums."" You go upstairs for the MATREX project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 

Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little :( Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the slushy rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this?? It's just a piece of paper! All that money and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, OMG, remember iPads??? OMG, remember Facebook??? OMG, remember OMG??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up from the basement. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication. 

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPzdi7AjmnI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

6:53pm
You check out the newly reopened Dodo's Message Board while you wait for the video to upload. <a href=""http://regretless.com/board/"" target=""_blank"" title=""DMB has reopened! Go JOIN!""><img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a190/iategijoe/dmb-button.gif"" style=""border:0"" /></a> Dinner's almost done. He threw out the bag! Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be near impossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Wouldn't matter. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your lavender sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but doesn't really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your hosting. Yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. Maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch Breaking Bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates Skyler, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put on yours as well. You're reading a SciFi/romance novel on your Kindle. Bryan gets out of the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.<br /><br /><a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg"" alt=""20130319-082958.jpg"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,
3/31/2013 20:50,4/1/2013 0:50,"So I completely forgot I had a blog.... Bad Lissy.

The most exciting thing that's happened at work are the automatic soap and towel dispensers.

Last Saturday, I met up with Rachi, Krissy and Shawn for lunch at Panchos Burritos. I hardly ever get to see Krissy, so that was a nice treat. I also met up with Tom and Carolyn later that day and we watched a show about evil kitties.

This past Friday I took off work since everyone else had off. I had lunch with my parents, where my dad made me order the veggie wrap because ""someone had to look out for my soul."" That made the waiter giggle. After, I went with Carolyn for a mani/pedi. My nails are so short I can't open anything now, lol. Sort is good though, I let them get too long and sharp.

We met up with the rest of the girls later for dinner at Grand Luxe and The Great and Powerful Oz in 3D. The food, movie and company were all fantastic. We really had a good time, it's a shame we don't get to do that more often. 

Normally we take Buffy for a long walk once while I'm home, but her legs have been terrible the past couple of weeks. She can only go about five limpy minutes before collapsing. Poor thing :( otherwise she's in perfect health. Just wish she could walk :(

My dad bought her booties so she wouldn't slip on the floor, but they seemed to just make it harder for her. <br /><br /><a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130331-210144.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130331-210144.jpg"" alt=""20130331-210144.jpg"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

My parents came over early yesterday so my dad could fix our toilet before Bryan's parents came. He did, but not without a lot of effort. And the new flushing mechanism is too tall for the toilet. At least it works now! Dinner was pretty great. Good foods. Everyone liked my carrot ginger soup. Bryan's mommy made adorable Easter cupcakes. Nana got us chocolate and wine :D ",Happy Easter!,,,,,,

Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water.

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrYou put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat.

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication.

Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in.

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

The lower body workout is short, but boy was my butt hurting the next day! Awesome! And my abs! My poor, poor abs! It would have been had if I didn't have cramps this week too :( I survived though!

I'm been doing well with the tic tacs. Averaging only about six a day. Already had two today though :O

Haven't been doing as well with the non pigging out. Not my fault! Maryam invited us over for dinner Friday. Do you know how yummy her food is??? I couldn't sit comfortably after I was so full, but it was worth it :P I took home leftovers too. That actually worked out well because Saturday we went to my cousin's Eagle Scout lunch thing and I knew if I didn't eat something before we went I'd be die, so I had a couple of Maryam's leek dumplings before we left around 10:30. I was so glad I did because they didn't start serving lunch until 1 and I'm starving by 11, so that would not have gone well at all. The pizza and pasta was pretty good though and always nice to see family :)

Yesterday we had dinner at Uno's because we didn't get enough pizza? Had the deep dish cookie sundae for dessert. Worth every single calorie. I was good the rest of the day, and we shared the dessert, so I gave myself credit for Sunday.

This week we have Jenny's lunch, because she's leaving :( And Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work pizza lunch, so this will be another challenging week. I might skip the pizza Thursday depending on how much we have leftover...

My mind went completely blank towards the end and I had to read my conclusion, but other than that, people seemed to like it. They laughed. Surprised me a little. A couple people said I was confident and not nervous ... are they sure they were talking about me?

This was the speech, password protected because it has a lot of personal information.

I Was Once a Wernick

My friend Carolyn was playing with my phone a few weeks ago and she noticed I hadn't changed her name in my contact list to her new married name so she went ahead and did it for me. At the time I thought she was being silly, I donât even look at her last name when I call her, but after thinking about it, I realized I would probably do the same thing. Why? What does it mean to be a Backas?

Itâs not like I didn't like my last name. I was a Wernick for 24 years. In that time I've shared my name with my dad, my mom, my grandma and our two dogs. 

I used to tell Princess she was a true Wernick because she acted like breakfast was the most exciting thing ever. She even had a habit of stealing Buffy's food when she wasn't looking. Wernicks are very serious about our food. 

Weâre also very sentimental and tend to produce a lot of clutter. We rarely throw things away. My parents still have my training potty and my baby teeth. If you've ever seen my office you know I like to surround myself with my childhood toys and photographs. If you think I have a lot of toys, you should see my dadâs workspace.

Weâre very into TV. I used to watch Matlock with my grandma and sheâd watch Hey Dude with me. When we go up to the Poconos, instead of hiking, we mostly stay inside and watch Law and Order marathons.

We're smart people. My dad and I both went into computer science. Even Buffy, the least intelligent of the family is smart enough to know to bark at my parents when I leave because she canât stop me, but they can. I can almost hear her crying, âWhat are you doing??? Sheâs leaving! Barricade the doors!â

Of course changing my name didn't mean losing these family traits. Iâll always be a Wernick. Now Iâm also a Backas and part of a new family, creating our own crazy quirks. Itâs not just his family name, itâs our family name and now we get to decide what that means. 

Our little Backas family of two is very health conscious. We eat a lot of veggies and quinoa and exercise together at night while watching Breaking Bad or Doctor Who.

We save our money for important things, like our yearly trip to Disney World. Our goal is to get our picture with as many different characters as possible.

We're musical. Bryan writes and produces music and I sing.

I know a lot of women think taking your husbandâs name is old fashioned, weâre not the property of men anymore, but thatâs not what it means at all. Itâs a way of telling the world, yes, Iâm married to this fellow and weâre now a single family unit.

My mom didn't legally change her name until recently but everyone called her Mrs Wernick anyway. Fair or not, society has adopted the women take the manâs last name convention, but that worked out well for me.

Yes, we would be the same family if we called ourselves by any other name, and no, thereâs nothing wrong with being a Wernick, but being a Backas has its perks. Going from a W to a B has been a bit like a promotion in the alphabet. 

I donât think people realize the discrimination end-of-the-alphabet people have to face. Always in the back, always last.

The worst was Rutgers graduation. Do you know how many people there were in my graduating class? Enough to fill hours of name calling.I had never been so bored in my entire life. By the time they got to my name, only half of the audience was still sitting and they were making so much noise, my parents didnât hear them call my name, nor could they see me walking up to get my diploma.  

Iâm also more unique now. There were a few other Elissa Wernicks in the world, but according to Google, I am the only Elissa Backas. When one searches for Elissa Backas, they find me and not some podiatrist in New York.The spelling is actually so rare, I think my husband is the only Bryan Backas as well. 

Of course I will always have documents, degrees, awards and credit cards in my maiden name. I know Iâm still Wernick in several systems at at&t because Iâm always seeing Elissa Wernick at the top of webpages. Plus my attuid will always start with ew, but that makes me a little happy.  I will always be a Wernick no matter what my last name is. I havenât given up an identity, but created a new one that encompasses the old. I get the best of both worlds and two amazing families.",The password is my last name,,,,,,

The most exciting thing that's happened at work are the automatic soap and towel dispensers.

Last Saturday, I met up with Rachi, Krissy and Shawn for lunch at Panchos Burritos. I hardly ever get to see Krissy, so that was a nice treat. I also met up with Tom and Carolyn later that day and we watched a show about evil kitties.

This past Friday I took off work since everyone else had off. I had lunch with my parents, where my dad made me order the veggie wrap because ""someone had to look out for my soul."" That made the waiter giggle. After, I went with Carolyn for a mani/pedi. My nails are so short I can't open anything now, lol. Sort is good though, I let them get too long and sharp.

We met up with the rest of the girls later for dinner at Grand Luxe and The Great and Powerful Oz in 3D. The food, movie and company were all fantastic. We really had a good time, it's a shame we don't get to do that more often. 

Normally we take Buffy for a long walk once while I'm home, but her legs have been terrible the past couple of weeks. She can only go about five limpy minutes before collapsing. Poor thing :( otherwise she's in perfect health. Just wish she could walk :(

My dad bought her booties so she wouldn't slip on the floor, but they seemed to just make it harder for her. <br /><br /><a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130331-210144.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130331-210144.jpg"" alt=""20130331-210144.jpg"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>

My parents came over early yesterday so my dad could fix our toilet before Bryan's parents came. He did, but not without a lot of effort. And the new flushing mechanism is too tall for the toilet. At least it works now! Dinner was pretty great. Good foods. Everyone liked my carrot ginger soup. Bryan's mommy made adorable Easter cupcakes. Nana got us chocolate and wine :D ",Happy Easter!,,,,,,

The folks I've interviewed this year have definitely been better than previous years, so at least I'm talking to intelligent people, but it's a little exhausting and extremely time consuming. Can't go on too much longer I guess, the interns start in a little over a month.

I just got an email from a headhunter who found my blog. Do I give off the impression here that I'm looking for a job? Note to any future headhunters who find this: I really like my job, not because i love programming, but because I work with awesome people and you cant trade awesome people for money. So unless its an acting job ... on Broadway ... in Wicked, I'll save you the time: no thanks.

Spent most of Saturday with Rachi. Had foods, went shopping, bought flamingo earrings I left at my parents' house. Spent the rest of the weekend watching home videos with them.

Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water.

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate.

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrkouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back.

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat.

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication. 

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPzdi7AjmnI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

6:53pm
You check out the newly reopened Dodo's Message Board while you wait for the video to upload. <a href=""http://regretless.com/board/"" target=""_blank"" title=""DMB has reopened! Go JOIN!""><img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a190/iategijoe/dmb-button.gif"" style=""border:0"" /></a> Dinner's almost done. He threw out the bag! Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your pink sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but diesnt really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your site. yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch breaking bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates skylar, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 



You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put in yours as well. You read your SciFi/romance novel. Bryan gets out if the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.<br /><br /><a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg"" alt=""20130319-082958.jpg"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,

My boring description of Monday, 3/18/2013

<!--more-->

5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of your breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicates. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one of the cardio workouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while. Of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, but you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. Taht'll be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Someone locked Maryam's laptop in the empty office. She and Nitika had to go down to security to free it :D Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat.

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (you have a Rutgers mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son was 2010. Nitika is the ""a"" and ""um"" counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies.

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this?? It's just a piece of paper! All that money and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, OMG, remember iPads??? OMG, remember Facebook??? OMG, remember OMG??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up from the basement. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication.

Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be near impossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Wouldn't matter. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in.

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your lavender sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but doesn't really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your hosting. Yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. Maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch Breaking Bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates Skyler, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put on yours as well. You're reading a SciFi/romance novel on your Kindle. Bryan gets out of the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.<br /><br /><a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/20130319-082958.jpg"" alt=""20130319-082958.jpg"" class=""alignnone size-full"" /></a>",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,

Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrkouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg""><img title=""20130318_114204.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg"" /></a> 

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication.

You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat.

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication. 

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPzdi7AjmnI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

6:53pm
You check out the newly reopened Dodo's Message Board while you wait for the video to upload. <a href=""http://regretless.com/board/"" target=""_blank"" title=""DMB has reopened! Go JOIN!""><img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a190/iategijoe/dmb-button.gif"" style=""border:0"" /></a> Dinner's almost done. He threw out the bag! Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitam

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your pink sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but diesnt really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your site. yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch breaking bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates skylar, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put in yours as well. You read your SciFi/romance novel. Bryan gets out if the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,
3/18/2013 22:15,3/19/2013 2:15,"5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You defide to dYou put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today.

You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge.

Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication.

Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your pink sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but diesnt really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your site. yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch breaking bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates skylar, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put in yours as well. You read your SciFi/romance novel. Bryan gets out if the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,
3/18/2013 22:17,3/19/2013 2:17,"5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrkouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg""><img title=""20130318_114204.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg"" /></a> 

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge.

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet.

You look online to see if you can save money on your site. yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch breaking bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates skylar, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put in yours as well. You read your SciFi/romance novel on you kindle. Bryan gets out if the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,
3/18/2013 22:16,3/19/2013 2:16,"5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water.

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate.

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrkouts from the lat boYou put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg""><img title=""20130318_114204.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_114204.jpg"" /></a> 

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication. 

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPzdi7AjmnI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

6:53pm
You check out the newly reopened Dodo's Message Board while you wait for the video to upload. <a href=""http://regretless.com/board/"" target=""_blank"" title=""DMB has reopened! Go JOIN!""><img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a190/iategijoe/dmb-button.gif"" style=""border:0"" /></a> Dinner's almost done. He threw out the bag! Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

The eggplant has been so yummy lately, oily, but yummy. You ask Nitika if she's going to toastmasters, she is :) Smeet Q's you a question about progressions. You get some water. :O someone left cupcakes on the counter. You do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake, you do not need a cupcake. They smell super sweet anyway, you pass. More gum. Time to go downstairs. Maryam's computer is done, so she won't come. You go pick up Nitika. You pass David in the hall, he's not coming either.

12:00pm
You arrive at the meeting. The lady next to you asks if you went to Rutgers (your mug) you say yeah, class 2007. Her son it's 2010. Nitika is the a and um counter. The first speaker is too good to be here. The second speaker is also good. Nitika's table topic is on kids and gadgets. You have to talk about girl scout cookies. You talked for about a minute and you had four ums. You go upstairs for the matrex project meeting. You accidentally take your evaluation sheets, oops

1:05 pm
In the meeting, the API teams asks if any of the mentors can help setting up their env for Spring MVC. You never have, but you offered to try to help. You go back to your office. You ask Maryam if she knows anything about that, she doesn't. She unplugged her old computer already. She didn't realize she has to wipe it first. You Q Pooja Reuven's attuid. Hopefully he knows more than you. 

Fitbit step check:  8035

You chew gum. You get some water. You look into this Spring thing, hopefully you can offer some insight. Nitika asks you if you know where to find a form. You say the CDT site, but you can't find it on there. You tell her to ask Jeanne.

You tell Pooja that you have a special program that automatically sets up a Spring project for you if she wants to come and look at what it did. The girls come over, but you don't think this will be much help. You send them your zip of the test project anyway. You try to do a simple HelloWorld program following a tutorial.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/desktop-300x168.jpg"" alt=""desktop"" width=""300"" height=""168"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4155"" /></a>

Oh boy, they got it working! You sign up for the Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work event on volunteer match and supposedly it'll then show up on some other site where you're supposed to log your hours... Maryam Q's you. How come it let her install the program and not you? You try again. Works if you don't save it to program files, he he. 

3:00pm
Swetha comes for her mentoring session. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-050-300x216.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-050"" width=""300"" height=""216"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4169"" /></a>

You finished your section on time management last time. She just found out she has to work on the API stuff now for the MATREX project, specifically the database connectivity stuff, so you both look at the Spring tutorial. Very different from struts. OMG you'll have to read this whole thing. You ask her if she wants to start the networking section or if you should add something about Spring. You both agree that Spring would probably be more helpful, so you'll modify the mentor plan. She sends you links, they're the same ones you sent Pooja :D

You hear a party in the hall, so you open your door to see what's going on. Gil, Nadeem and Kashif are talking to Maryam about her new laptop. You say you have one too. You talk about girlscout cookies. They all like Samoas. You go get water and your yogurt snack from the fridge. 
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg""><img title=""20130318_154132.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_154132.jpg"" /></a> 


Swetha Q's you the snv path. Now you have to read about snv too. More gum. You check out google reader while you wait for the plugin to install. You decide it's probably easier to read the tutorial on the iPad. OK, this has to be your last piece of gum.

Summaya Qs you and asks you about Toastmasters. The URL Swetha gave you doesn't appear to work. Or maybe you have no idea what you're doing. You feel sleepy. You decide to work on migrating the configuration for some of your programs. You copy the eclipse plugin to your penguin. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-051-300x204.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-051"" width=""300"" height=""204"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4170"" /></a>

You add your SQL connections to SQLDeveloper. You hiccup on the way to the bathroom. You see Maryam leaving on the way back. She's leaving early to take her daughter to the doctor, not because it's snowing. Golly Windows7 makes things difficult. Yay, plugin is installed. Today was a little boring wasn't it?

No one volunteered to be the new One Team supply manager. You'll have to choose someone. You choose a few candidates based on proximity to the supply cabinet. You'll see who doesn't come to the meeting tomorrow, muahaha. You're sure you'll end up doing most of the work anyway. You put together the rest of the agenda and send it out. You remember you have to setup your printers. You setup one, but it's late, you'll do the other one tomorrow.

5:36pm
You pack up your laptop and your food containers and head home. (Note: I wrote the following after I was at home. Don't text and drive!) So cold! The wind blows some icey rain in your face. You wait for a guy to back out of his spot. You take 35 home as you have been since your accident. Oh great, he's turning into the left lane on 35 too, now you're gonna be stuck behind the slow guy. Oh good, he's getting over to the right. Less traffic than usual today, but more wind. It blows your car around a little, gah! Payphone, terrible song, you switch stations. Ah, the rain turns to freezing rain, fun! If it's like this tomorrow, you're working from home. You make it home OK and Bryan greets you at the door.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-053-151x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-053"" width=""151"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4167"" /></a>

Natalie's gift he ordered forever ago finally came. So did your registration. WTF is this? It's just a piece of paper! All that money I pay and they don't laminate it??? They don't even bother with perforations?? Guess you'll just stick the whole piece of paper in your wallet. Bryan fixed the toilet in the master bathroom, yay :D He'll start dinner soon. You hope so, you're hungry.

You check Facebook on your iPad. Ten years from now you'll be like, omg, remember iPads??? Looks like Carolyn had a bad day. Bryan comes up. You demand he go in the kitchen and make you food! He says ""you're the awesomest and stuff."" He's hungry too. He might have a WHOLE wrap tonight. Laundry time. Oh, you didn't open the mail from Mickey. It's an autograph picture hoping we created magical memories on our vacation. Well that took a long time to come. I guess Mickey didn't know what he was going to write. OK, now it's laundry time.

You gather laundry from upstairs and bring it down to the basement. You sort it and do a load of darks. You clean the lint filter on the dryer. Your sweatband didn't make it into the wash, whatever, you have a bunch. You put your food containers in the sink. You somehow make a mess doing that one simple thing. You start prepping your breakfast for tomorrow: Peanut butter apple overnight oats. You record a video. Oh crap, how do you sign into youtube. Damn two step authentication. 

<iframe width=""420"" height=""315"" src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/IPzdi7AjmnI"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe>

6:53pm
You check out the newly reopened Dodo's Message Board while you wait for the video to upload. <a href=""http://regretless.com/board/"" target=""_blank"" title=""DMB has reopened! Go JOIN!""><img src=""http://i11.photobucket.com/albums/a190/iategijoe/dmb-button.gif"" style=""border:0"" /></a> Dinner's almost done. He threw out the bag! Or the contents of the bag that had been sitting by the door since Christmas. Good job! You tell Bryan someone on DMB likes his taste in T-Shirts. Bryan comes back upstairs and says the food has been done for a while. You take some. Mexican quinoa wraps. You gobble down half a wrap and pack some up for lunch tomorrow. Ice cream time! You're pretty excited about trying the new butter pecan gelato. It's yummy. Too yummy. Good thing it's cold out or it would be extremely near ipossible to stop eating. The caramel one is probably still better though. You take your vitamins.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_1917061.jpg""><img title=""20130318_191706.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_1917061.jpg"" /></a> 

You play a round of You Don't Know Jack. Why's there no sound? Oh, sound's off. Heh. Apparently the Red Baron is German. *shrugs* You don't like the way their yoga question was worded. Guess you're not up on your Eddie Murphy movies. Well, you're not doing so good. Easy Jack Attack, but you messed up. Fifth place, ouch. Let's try another one because that was pathetic. This isn't going much better. Actually it's going worse. Maybe you should't multitask. Another easy Jack Attack. Fourth place. Meh. That's enough embarrassment for one day. You're still a little hungry, so you have a few cocoa roast almonds. You haven't visited Chau's site in a while and since you're actually on your laptop, you go and do that. Your mommy calls. You tell her you ate at the Cheesecake Factory over the weekend. She wants to know what you're doing for Easter. You tell her everyone can come to your house. 

Bryan sends you this: <a href=""http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html"">http://gma.yahoo.com/blogs/abc-blogs/dachshund-pups-caught-nuzzling-capybara-173906435--abc-news-topstories.html</a> You go downstairs and put the clothes in the dryer. You finish reading Chau's blog. You check the weather. Just rain tomorrow. Guess you're going in. 

Fitbit step check: 10364

You go upstairs to brush your teeth, wash you face and pick out clothes for tomorrow. You also get fresh towels for you and Bryan.

You decide to go with your pink sweater tomorrow. That thing is super old, but diesnt really look it. 

You look online to see if you can save money on your site. yeah, if you pay $700 for ten years. maybe you'll get two years. Time to watch breaking bad and jump while Bryan's on the elliptical. You don't know why everyone hates skylar, she seems to be the only one on the show with any sense at all. 

You go upstairs, take out your contacts, use your nasal spray and take your pill. You put your fitbit in its nighty and put in yours as well. You read your SciFi/romance novel. Bryan gets out if the shower and you cuddle for a bit before he puts on the an and turns out the lights.",A Day in the Life 2013,,,,,,
3/18/2013 22:16,3/19/2013 2:16,"5:??am 
Bryan's moving. You check your fitbit, too early, you go back to sleep.

6:30am
Your fitbit vibrating alarm startles you awake, gaah! Owies, your back is sore from Yoga yesterday, maybe elliptical is a better plan than kettle bell today. Your phone alarm goes off, ok, ok, getting up. You go into the other room and head downstairs using your phone as a flashlight.
You heat up some water. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg""><img title=""20130318_063435.jpg"" class=""aligncenter size-full"" alt=""image"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wpid-20130318_063435.jpg"" /></a>

You eat a little of yr breakfast, chocolate banana peanut butter overnight oats, yum, :p you finish off your water and head upstairs for contacts, teeth brushing and exercise clothes dressing.
Where's your heart monitor strap? Why wouldn't you put it on the back of the door? There it is, on the chair with your other delicate. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-043-181x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-043"" width=""181"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4171"" /></a>

You go down to the basement and hop on the elliptical. You decide to do one if the cardio wrkouts from the lat bootcamp. You put on last night's episode of the walking dead. Oh poor Andrea. You watch the news while you stretch. Supposed to be bad weather later today. How much later? You head upstairs to shower.

This sulfate free shampoo is supposed to be better for your hair, but you haven't noticed a difference. You wash your hair, shave, wash the rest of you. Put on lotion, comb your hair, put on foundation. You decided to wear your big grey sweater since it's not likely to get this cold again this year.

8:30am
You put on your boots, grab you stuff and time to leave. You were telling Bryan yesterday how you haven't cursed at the Quickcheck light in a while... of course you get stopped at that light today. You listen to Z100 while you drive. They make a comment about how you shouldn't browse Pinterest while hungry. You agree, you do it all the time.

You arrive at work and the parking lot is pretty full. Good, hopefully people aren't working from home. You see Varun and his wife at the elevators and wave hello. The stairs up to the fifth floor are a little harder with your new laptop on your back. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-045-300x219.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-045"" width=""300"" height=""219"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4168"" /></a>

You arrive at your office. Maryam sees you taking a picture and asks you if you're doing A Day in the Life. You say yeah, she runs away. Anthony comes in and asks if he does something on his own time after work, does at&t own it. You tell him unless he creates the next Facebook, you don't think they'll care. You check your email.

Noooo, Sumayya's working from home :( She's sick :( Maryam has her laptop migration going in the office across from yours. What will be Nitika's new office soon :)

Fitbit step check:  5722

9:15am
You finish your breakfast. Your mug top fell on the floor last week. You go to the kicthen to wash your mug, get some hot water and put your food away.

You chew gum. Nitika messages you saying she's not going to worry about her putty config stuff, she'll just put it in manually. Meh, that'll take forever. You have many complicated color stuff. She didn't even know you could do that with Putty. Maryam asks if they transferred all your programs too, no, just files and it's a lot more strict about what you can install. At least you have everything you really need.

You and Maryam get to do an interview together Thursday, yay :) You have to do another motor vehicle check for the strike duty stuff again, boo. You can't believe that stuff isn't settled yet. You're not tall enough to drive the trucks anyway. Proving all this personal info makes you nervous, but they sent like 50 emails saying we should do this, so it's probably a huge deal if we don't. Crap, your meeting's in 15 minutes.

Hmm, should you bring your laptop? Eh, you already printed out the HLD, but that was before she made changes. Maybe you should bring the laptop. Or print a new version.... hmm, save paper or save energy... Eh, you'll bring the laptop. It's still a novelty at this point :) You'll need your secure ID thing though. And you should go to the bathroom first. Mary won't be at the meeting, but it still might go long, you never know. Why is your mouse not working properly. You hope it's not dying 'cause you're not getting a new one... 

Brij and Summaya's office is dark, is Brij home too?? You unsuccessfully try to take a picture of yourself in the mirror. Someone walks in, it's just Nitika. She offers to try to take a picture of you, but it doesn't work out well. You'll try with your camera later.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048.jpg""><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/dayinlifeanddis-048-199x300.jpg"" alt=""dayinlifeanddis-048"" width=""199"" height=""300"" class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4173"" /></a>

9:58am
You go down to the fourth floor. No one's in the room, but someone's laptop is here. Teri walks in, you say hello. Anthony comes in, he's jealous of your laptop. Teri has an extra document for him. You log into VPN. Oh, Mary's on the phone, yeah, this'll be a long meeting. Counting multibays are apparently very complicated. A new field, meh. Your mouse touchpad isn't working. Working again. Wow, even Shu looks confused. This is gonna be a pain in the butt.

After the call you talk afterwards about whether we should bother implementing the new feature into autositeplan. You ask Teri if the new fields will show on the reports. Yes. Then all the reports need to be listed in the HLD. Jenny suggests you use a function to create the technology name. You think that's a very good idea. You ask her if she wants to write it before she leaves. Everyone laughs. Her contract expires at the end of next month :(

11:15am
Back up to your office. You check your email. You see Smita on the way to the bathroom so you walk over to say hi. She's just back from maternity leave. Back in your office, you chew some more gum. $120 to renew your hosting? It was half that last year :(

Maryam's bored (she can't use her PC while her data's being migrated.) You tell her to come to the Toastmasters meeting today. She will.
 Time to buy lunch. Salad today. You have to wait a couple minutes for the cafeteria to open. No good soups, but the salad should be enough. You climb back up to your office and eat.

4/8/2013 14:28,4/8/2013 18:28,"I had my first speech for Toastmasters today. I did OK. My mind went completely blank towards the end and I had to read my conclusion, but other than that, people seemed to like it. They laughed. Surprised me a little. A couple people said I was confident and not nervous ... are they sure they were talking about me?

This was the speech, password protected because it has a lot of personal information.

I Was Once a Wernick

My friend Carolyn was playing with my phone a few weeks ago and she noticed I hadn't changed her name in my contact list to her new married name so she went ahead and did it for me. At the time I thought she was being silly, I donât even look at her last name when I call her, but after thinking about it, I realized I would probably do the same thing. Why? What does it mean to be a Backas?

Itâs not like I didn't like my last name. I was a Wernick for 24 years. In that time I've shared my name with my dad, my mom, my grandma and our two dogs. 

I used to tell Princess she was a true Wernick because she acted like breakfast was the most exciting thing ever. She even had a habit of stealing Buffy's food when she wasn't looking. Wernicks are very serious about our food. 

Weâre also very sentimental and tend to produce a lot of clutter. We rarely throw things away. My parents still have my training potty and my baby teeth. If you've ever seen my office you know I like to surround myself with my childhood toys and photographs. If you think I have a lot of toys, you should see my dadâs workspace.

Weâre very into TV. I used to watch Matlock with my grandma and sheâd watch Hey Dude with me. When we go up to the Poconos, instead of hiking, we mostly stay inside and watch Law and Order marathons.

We're smart people. My dad and I both went into computer science. Even Buffy, the least intelligent of the family is smart enough to know to bark at my parents when I leave because she canât stop me, but they can. I can almost hear her crying, âWhat are you doing??? Sheâs leaving! Barricade the doors!â

Of course changing my name didn't mean losing these family traits. Iâll always be a Wernick. Now Iâm also a Backas and part of a new family, creating our own crazy quirks. Itâs not just his family name, itâs our family name and now we get to decide what that means. 

Our little Backas family of two is very health conscious. We eat a lot of veggies and quinoa and exercise together at night while watching Breaking Bad or Doctor Who.

We save our money for important things, like our yearly trip to Disney World. Our goal is to get our picture with as many different characters as possible.

We're musical. Bryan writes and produces music and I sing.

I know a lot of women think taking your husbandâs name is old fashioned, weâre not the property of men anymore, but thatâs not what it means at all. Itâs a way of telling the world, yes, Iâm married to this fellow and weâre now a single family unit.

My mom didn't legally change her name until recently but everyone called her Mrs Wernick anyway. Fair or not, society has adopted the women take the manâs last name convention, but that worked out well for me.

Yes, we would be the same family if we called ourselves by any other name, and no, thereâs nothing wrong with being a Wernick, but being a Backas has its perks. Going from a W to a B has been a bit like a promotion in the alphabet. 

I donât think people realize the discrimination end-of-the-alphabet people have to face. Always in the back, always last.

The worst was Rutgers graduation. Do you know how many people there were in my graduating class? Enough to fill hours of name calling.I had never been so bored in my entire life. By the time they got to my name, only half of the audience was still sitting and they were making so much noise, my parents didnât hear them call my name, nor could they see me walking up to get my diploma.  

Iâm also more unique now. There were a few other Elissa Wernicks in the world, but according to Google, I am the only Elissa Backas. When one searches for Elissa Backas, they find me and not some podiatrist in New York.The spelling is actually so rare, I think my husband is the only Bryan Backas as well. 

Of course I will always have documents, degrees, awards and credit cards in my maiden name. I know Iâm still Wernick in several systems at at&t because Iâm always seeing Elissa Wernick at the top of webpages. Plus my attuid will always start with ew, but that makes me a little happy.  I will always be a Wernick no matter what my last name is. I havenât given up an identity, but created a new one that encompasses the old. I get the best of both worlds and two amazing families.",The password is my last name,,,,,,

I've been doing over 10,000 steps every day regardless of giving myself a check for that, so I changed that goal to help me quit my gum chewing. The first week was only 5 pieces of gum a day, the second, 0 :O I did accomplish this, of course I was eating about 15 tic tacs a day instead. So my new goal this week is going to be 10 tic tacs a day.
I'm also going to try to incorporate more Yoga into my workouts because Yoga's awesome. 

My other goal is simply not to eat like a piggy. Something I failed miserably at this week, but I was sick :( --/good excuse--

I ran out of dymista this week and the price went up to $51. I thought about not taking anything, but then I got the cold, so now I'm back on Zyrtec. If I don't take anything for my allergies at this point, I'll get a sinus infection (if I don't have one already) and be sick for weeks :( --/good excuse--

Went to my parents' this weekend. My mom and I went through my old baby tapes while my dad was working. We plan on converting them to DVD, so we needed to figure out which ones actually had me on them and which ones were reruns of 80s dramas. We went through about 20 unlabeled tapes. One was for a book report I did when I was 12 that I taped with my Tyco Video Cam. It was a little creepy. One was of course, me with Jerry O'Connell on TRL. That one was labeled: ""You lose this and you are in so much trouble!""

4/22/2013 10:08,4/22/2013 14:08,"This has actually been my favorite set of workouts for <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a> so far. The lower body workout is short, but boy was my butt hurting the next day! Awesome! And my abs! My poor, poor abs! It would have been had if I didn't have cramps this week too :( I survived though!

I'm been doing well with the tic tacs. Averaging only about six a day. Already had two today though :O

Haven't been doing as well with the non pigging out. Not my fault! Maryam invited us over for dinner Friday. Do you know how yummy her food is??? I couldn't sit comfortably after I was so full, but it was worth it :P I took home leftovers too. That actually worked out well because Saturday we went to my cousin's Eagle Scout lunch thing and I knew if I didn't eat something before we went I'd be die, so I had a couple of Maryam's leek dumplings before we left around 10:30. I was so glad I did because they didn't start serving lunch until 1 and I'm starving by 11, so that would not have gone well at all. The pizza and pasta was pretty good though and always nice to see family :)

Yesterday we had dinner at Uno's because we didn't get enough pizza? Had the deep dish cookie sundae for dessert. Worth every single calorie. I was good the rest of the day, and we shared the dessert, so I gave myself credit for Sunday.

This week we have Jenny's lunch, because she's leaving :( And Take Our Sons and Daughters to Work pizza lunch, so this will be another challenging week. I might skip the pizza Thursday depending on how much we have leftover...

I work at AT&T in New Jersey. Currently I'm doing web development in Java. I enjoy designing websites and programming in general, as long as pointers aren't involved. My favorite programming languages are Java, PHP and XSL. I spend most of my time online reading blogs.

I love my family (including puppies) and friends more than anything. I feel very lucky that I have so many awesome people in my life.

I exercise six days a week, mostly so I can eat more food. I really like food, especially Japanese food, Indian food and spaghetti, with Trader Joeâs Meatless Meatballs. Ooh, and pizza. I eat a lot of pizza. I love smores, cookies, Gobstoppers and ice cream. I make the best smores ice cream.

I watch quite a few shows, often while exercising: Doctor Who, House, Glee, Grey's Anatomy, The Big Bang Theory, The Walking Dead, Covert Affairs and Gossip Girl. Bryan and I also love Farscape and Firefly.

I like to sing. See my <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/etcfiles/evilsquirrels.wmv"">Evil Squirrels video</a>. I like happy music. I mostly listen to Broadway, Disney, Christmas music during the season, plus other random stuff.

Two weekends ago was my birthday party. Good times, good food. Too much food. Julia made so many yummy things. Her Mac 'n Cheese, omg. And she made me a special mini cake :D And Rachi made me smores pops :O I didn't even eat any of my ice cream. Sunday we went out with Bryan's parents to Fridays. I tried to be good. I got Salmon with lots of veggies. <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a> started again this week, hopefully that'll get me back on track. 

Last Thursday we went out to eat at work and it was a mini disaster. I guess no one took Eddie's email seriously when he said the menu completely changed. The food was very different. I liked Sumayya's salmon, but that was about it. My shrimp was OK, but it was really fried and $19, which is quite a bit for lunch. We won't be returning anytime soon.

This past weekend I went over my parents'. Got presies :D Some Doctor Who stuff, an air purifier and plenty of cocoa powder.

We were going to get my dad a rotisserie for father's day, but it's still on backorder. I used my att referral points to get movie tickets in the meantime. We say This is the End. I thought it was funny, my parents, not so much. At least it was free.

Poor Buffy is in pretty bad shape :( We spent a good portion of the weekend cleaning pee and poo off of her. She hates it. We're taking her to the vet on Friday to see what we can do. She really needs a wheelchair, but I don't see her taking well to something like that. We'll see.

Friday night was Krissy's birthday party. She had a fancy garden party full of delicious vegan and non-vegan goodies. I made vegan cookie dough ice cream that turned out pretty good. 

Buffy got new pain killers and was up for a walk Sunday afternoon. She went half a block and back again. She was very happy.

Saturday, I helped Julia with Helen and Darian's engagement photo shoot in Holmdel Park.

There was also a lot of frozen yogurt last week. Guanjone took us out, and then we went to the same place on Saturday after the photos  :P

Today I'm working from my parents' house. I have work to do in another system and I don't really understand which way is up. I hate that. 

Byran's awesome parents are coming over to our place today to help us paint the bathroom. :D  Yeah, and I'm here. I should be there, but I have to come back here Saturday and that's a lot of back and forth :-/ And Buffy appreciates I'm here to help give her a bath today.

Sorry I haven't been commenting on blogs. My company is blocking you guys and I haven't had much free time otherwise to visit. Actually, I don't have free time at work either these days. Can you believe they're actually giving me work to do at work? The nerve, right? Probably a little too much to do, but still a nice change from being bored. Even when I had NDR work, it wasn't exactly challenging. Now I'm learning all new stuff. Bizarre stuff that isn't useful anywhere else, but like I said, not bored.

And Helen's surprise bridal shower was this past Sunday :) And we successfully surprised her. Her reaction was priceless. So many yummy things and fun games. I gotta steal some of those for work events. 

Our bathroom looks so nice. <3 Bryan's parents. They're twelve kinds of awesome. Of course now our dryer isn't working.

That project that was driving me crazy was postponed... Mostly because I couldn't finish it which sucks, but I tried, I really tried. I didn't do the design, not my fault it ended up way more complicated then they estimated. Maybe a little. And I'm new. I think I did pretty good for someone not familiar with the code. Whatever, I'm way less stressed now, stopped losing weight, everything's back to normal.

Speaking of losing weight, summer <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Best Body Bootcamp</a> has come to an end :( That's a full year of Tina's workouts. I'd like to try something different, but you really can't beat her program. I'm starting to sound like an infomercial here, but where else can you get that variety for the price?

I spent most of the day yesterday obsessing about the couch I ordered. Trying to figure out how to make it work in the living room. I finally decided I couldn't and I cancelled the order :-/ Bryan's pretty sad. He really liked the couch. :(

Friday and Saturday were much happier. Bryan and I went down to Atlantic City with my dad for a cousins reunion. First time there. We're not into gambling, but we did shop quite a bit and racked up 24,000 steps in the process. Does that make up for today? The seagulls down there are surprisingly aggressive.

Friday and Saturday were much happier. Bryan and I went down to Atlantic City with my dad for a cousins reunion. First time there.

8/3/2013 14:54,8/3/2013 18:54,"The Toastmasters speech I gave last week:

We all know weâre supposed to eat healthy and exercise, yet we donât. Itâs very difficult when there are constant temptations of ice cream and Law and Order marathons. New Years Resolutions, crash diets, any short term significant change is impossible to stick with. Living healthier requires a lifestyle change. The key is to create healthy habits, so we make healthy choices without even thinking about it.

Why are habits so important? Can you imagine what your life would be like if you woke up in the morning and you had to think about every single little decision you had to make? Should I shower or brush my teeth first? Should I wear shoes? How do I back out of my driveway?  It would be overwhelming and you would use up all of your willpower just getting to work. 

Willpower is a limited resource. The more you force yourself to do things you donât want to do, the less likely you are to make good decisions later in the day. In one study, participants were given a choice between a healthy snack and cookies and then later on given an impossible puzzle to solve. Those who picked the healthy snack gave up on the puzzle sooner than the folks who chose the cookies. 

So conserve your willpower. No, this doesn't mean gorging yourself on cookies. It means removing the cookie temptation by not keeping them around. But donât try to do to many changes at once.

Instead of completely cutting out junk food, start by limiting your soda intake. If you want to break your soda habit, you first need to figure out why you drink the soda. Habits are created when we reinforce an action with a reward.  If your reward is something sweet, switch out the soda for a piece of fruit. If itâs the caffeine, try drinking tea instead, if you like the bubbles, try seltzer.

I recently gave up my gum chewing habit this way. I always had a piece of gum when I wanted something sweet, which as it turns out, was all the time. I removed the gum from my office and replaced it with  tic-tacs. It didn't take any willpower to reach for a tic-tac instead since there wasn't any gum to tempt me. Fortunately, tic-tacs aren't nearly as satisfying as gum, and I haven't formed a tic-tac habit, but I no longer crave gum.

Forming an exercise habit was similar, though it was a much bigger change that required many small steps over a long period of time. After I graduated high school, I started walking around campus at Rutgers, and then doing yoga DVDs. When I started working I bought a treadmill and then weights. Ten years ago, I was a couch potato, now I exercise six days a week plus I take walks and go on hikes.

Small steps are the key. You wonât stick with an exercise program if youâre sore and miserable every day. You need to reward yourself, not punish yourself. This is my favorite exercise tool. Itâs my pedometer.

A pedometer is an instant reward system. You take a step and immediately youâre rewarded with a higher step count as opposed to changes in your body that can take weeks to see. Just by wearing one, you're more likely to be more active.

Just wear it the first few days without changing your habits and notice how many steps you take. Over the next week, try to beat your score by getting in 1,000 more steps each day. A thousand steps is about ten minutes of walking. Continue this pattern every week and before you know it, youâre taking walks down the hall during lunch and after work around your neighborhood because you NEED to reach your step goal. 10,000 steps a day is considered a good goal to work up to.

I also subscribe to an online exercise program: <a href=""http://www.tinareale.com/best-body-bootcamp/"">Tinaâs Best Body Bootcamp</a>. For $40, you get an 8 week exercise program, 3 days of strength workouts and 2 days of cardio each week. You also get a check in document to mark off when you've completed a workout or completed your two goals. The goals can be anything youâd like.

My current goals this week are to limit myself to one small treat and to reach 12,000 steps each day. When I complete a goal for the day, I mark an X on my checking document. 5 Xâs for the week places me in a drawing for a weekly prize. 20 Entries and I get placed in the drawing for the grand prize at the end of the 8 weeks. She also has a beginner program if you're new to working out. 

There are a few great things about this program. I donât have to think about what workout Iâm going to do in the morning, itâs right there in the plan. I can do the exercises at home or at a gym. Itâs also a good variety of exercises so it doesn't get boring. The Xâs act not only as a tracking tool, but  as a reward to reinforce a healthy action which makes it easy to stick to and form habits.

No matter how healthy we are, thereâs always ways we can improve. Make it easy for yourself by making efficient use of your willpower. Examine your life and your habits every few weeks and find one small thing you can change and go for it. It only takes a few weeks to form a new habit and once the habit is there, it's easy to stick with it. In time you'll be a healthier you. ",Toastmasters Speech: Healthy Habits,,,,,,

That project that was driving me crazy was postponed... Mostly because I couldn't finish it which sucks, but I tried, I really tried. I didn't do the design, not my fault it ended up way more complicated then they estimated. Maybe a little. And I'm new. I think I did pretty good for someone not familiar with the code. Whatever, I'm way less stressed now, stopped losing weight, everything's back to normal.

8/25/2013 9:08,8/25/2013 13:08,"Saturday morning I woke up early and left the house at 7 to meet Julia at Lyndhurst to catch the 7:57 into the city. We signed up for this programming contest for girls, The Hackettes, sponsored by Spotify.

<!--more-->

She wasn't at the train station when I got there, but she was very close. I bought the tickets, the train came, but Julia wasn't there yet. They asked me if I was getting on, I said my friend's not here yet, I'll wait. Julia got there less than a minute after the train left. The next one wasn't coming for an hour. We decided to drive to Seacaucus and catch the next train from there... Which was in 35 minutes. So we ended up about an hour behind schedule.

Things went more smoothly once we were in the city. We picked the right subway line and we didn't have much trouble finding the place, so we still got there on time. Good thing we missed the train or we would have been very early. 

Julia and I were put on a team with one other girl, Ophra, who turned out to be pretty awesome. We settled down, got some breakfast. They did a good job of catering to everyone's dietary needs. Julia was very excited about the vegan yogurt.

They also gave us nice goodie bags. We were like, you know what, even if we come in last, these t-shirts are awesome.

After breakfast, they revealed the challenge. We'd be creating hockey teams using their API, that would battle against each other. We named our team the Ice Hockettes and colored our players magenta and black. And of course, we named them after Disney princesses.

We looked at the sample code and read up a little on hockey. We made Pocahontas our center forward. She'd pass the puck to a teammate if they were closer to the goal than her, otherwise, she'd shoot it herself. Aurora and Cinderella didn't pass, they just shot if they had the puck. Mulan and Jasmine were our defenders. They would try and get the puck if it was near their goal, otherwise, they'd go after the closest opponent. Belle was our goalie who hung out in the middle of the goal and shot the puck in the other direction if she had it.

The three of us worked together on my laptop since I was the one with Java installed already :) I was only the only one who programs in Java on a daily basis, though the code was very simple, so I don't think that made that much of a difference.

We at lunch in the middle of coding. Again, good stuff. Many vegetarian options.

We made changes, tested, made changes, tested. We worked very well together and everyone contributed ideas. In our last iteration, I noticed one of the other teams skated with the puck before they shot it in, but the other goalie always blocked the shot because they were too close to the goal when they tried to shoot it. 

We changed our players to skate towards the goal if they had the puck and shoot when they were still a bit back from the goal. This seemed to increase their odds of getting the puck in the goal. Our team wasn't very good, but we didn't have much time left, so we submitted and decided to work on our banners.

They had really great arts and crafts stuff, and well, you know Julia.

We listened to some talks about Spotify and, oy, Agile. I have nothing against Agile, I'm on the Agile bandwagon, just a little sick of hearing about it.

Then our teams battled it out! They split us into four divisions with 3-4 teams playing against each other in the first round. Surprisingly, we won the first round! We celebrated with beer and hotdogs. Good hotdogs! I didn't try the beer, Julia didn't like it. They had wine too, but I was already sleepy and dehydrated.

Then the next round, we won again! And then again! We couldn't believe it! We made it to the finals and would at least get second place! We had to sit through a torturous game where the two runners up battled for third place and then came the final round.

We scored, they scored, we scored again and then a third time. We won! We actually won! We were absolutely shocked. 

We had our choice of prizes. There were iPad minis, wii u's, ticketmaster gift cards and experiences, like facials and helicopter rides. All three of us went with the iPads. 

Then we won again! For Julia's banners :D We got nerf guns. 

It was a pretty amazing day. The event was so well organized and everyone was super nice. I feel obligated to buy a Spotify account now :D I can't believe all of that was free. Hope we can do something like it again :)",The Hackettes,,,,,,
8/25/2013 9:08,8/25/2013 13:08,"Saturday morning I woke up early and left the house at 7 to meet Julia at Lyndhurst to catch the 7:57 into the city. We signed up for this programming contest for girls, The Hackettes, sponsored by Spotify.

<!--more-->

She wasn't at the train station when I got there, but she was very close. I bought the tickets, the train came, but Julia wasn't there yet. They asked me if I was getting on, I said my friend's not here yet, I'll wait. Julia got there less than a minute after the train left. The next one wasn't coming for an hour. We decided to drive to Seacaucus and catch the next train from there... Winch was in 35 minutes. So we ended up about an hour behind schedule.

Things went more smoothly once we were in the city. We picked the right subway line and we didn't have much trouble finding the place, so we still got there on time. Good thing we missed the train or we would have been very early. 

Julia and I were put on a team with one other girl, Ophra, who turned out to be pretty awesome. We settled down, got some breakfast. They did a good job of catering to everyone's dietary needs. Julia was very excited about the vegan yogurt.

They also gave us nice goodie bags. We were like, you know what, even if we come in last, these t-shirts are awesome.

After breakfast, they revealed the challenge. We'd be creating hockey teams using their API, that would battle against each other. We named our team the Ice Hockettes and colored our players magenta and black. And of course, we named them after Disney princesses.

We looked at the sample code and read up a little on hockey. We made Pocahontas our center forward. She'd pass the puck to a teammate if they were closer to the goal than her, otherwise, she'd shoot it herself. Aurora and Cinderella didn't pass, they just shot if they had the puck. Milan and Jasmine were our defenders. They would try and get the puck if it was near their goal, otherwise, they'd go after the closest opponent. Belle was our goalie who hung out in the middle of the goal and shot the puck in the other direction if she had it.

The three of us worked together on my laptop since I was the one with Java installed already :) I was only the only one who programs in Java on a daily basis, though the code was very simple, so I don't think that made that much of a difference.

We made changes, tested, made changes, tested. We worked very well together and everyone contributed ideas. In our last iteration, I noticed one of the other teams skated with the puck before they shot it in, but the other goalie always blocked the shot because they were too close to the goal when they tried to shoot it.

We at lunch in the middle of coding. Again, good stuff. Many vegetarian options. I liked the caramelly, nutty, chocolately thing I had for dessert too. 

Back to coding, we changed our players to skate towards the goal if they had the puck and shoot when they were still a bit back from the goal. This seemed to increase their odds of getting the puck in the goal. Our team wasn't very good, but we didn't have much time left, so we submitted and decided to work on our banners.

Unfortunately Brian and his girlfriend thought the party was Sunday. So they came by the next day and we had a second party.

I left early and headed to Lyndhurst to catch the train into the city with Julia for Helen's bachelorette party. Oh boy did we have fun. We had dinner at Alta, where they have drinks and tapas. We ordered the whole shebang - everything on the menu. They brought out a few plates at a time so we had a steady stream of interesting food to try. Everything between the sangria and dessert is a little fuzzy though. That sangria meant business. I lost my knife twice. It just disappeared. The food was very good though. Expensive, but reasonable for NY. 

After dinner was karaoke! I had everyone write their least favorite chores along with why they didn't like doing them at dinner. Before we started singing, I read them aloud with the intro- so and so doesn't like sex because, and then the reason they gave. This was my favorite: E doesn't like sex because she gets water all over the place and there are always more to do.

Then we sang and danced and had a jolly good time singing Spice Girls and show tunes :) so much fun that we missed our train and then we missed the last train home too. Helen and her sister ended up driving four of us back because they're awesome like that. 

I drove up to my parents' after and attempted to sleep, but I had caffeine to stay awake for the party and it seemed to have worked to well. Needless to say, I spent a lot of the day sleeping.

Today sucked in comparison. Mostly because I think I'm sick :( oh well, better after than before!",Party Lissy,,,,,,

We were supposed to have dinner with Chris and Rae, but they didn't want to eat that early. We decided to try In-N-Out. It was good, for fast food. After we went to Chris and Rae's where we found out we're going to have a little niece or nephew :) we went out for gelato in downtown Mountain View to celebrate.

Sunday we went to Muir Woods. The woods there are much different then here. No bugs, it's bizarre and so quiet. Those trees are absolutely huge. It was very pretty. Very glad we went Sunday since it was closed the rest of the week because of the government shutdown.

We had dinner at the place eye were supposed to go Saturday night, Rok Bistro, where you cook your food on a hot stone. It was really good. Rae got the kangaroo and we tried some, not bad. Dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal. S'mores fondue, omg.

We went into the city on Monday. Waked around Union Square, a big mall just like the malls here, and had lunch at a Thai place. We wanted dessert, so ewe waked to a highly rated gelato place in the North Beach area. Definitely an good as the gelato in Rome.

We went back to the hotel for a nap and then went over Chris and Rae's again to watch the series finale of Breaking Bad. Good ending.

Tuesday we went to the Intel museum and then ate lunch at Apple with Chris. Bryan and I got suchi and gelato.

After lunch we headed over to Palo Alto and went shopping in the downtown area and then took a long walk to Stanford and saw the sculpture garden. I've now been to Harvard, Columbia and Stanford, but not Princeton even though it's the closest.

Wednesday we were meeting up with Bryan's family in the city. We got a little lost on the way there and ended up being forced over the Bay Bridge. In general, the driving sucked. We finally made it though and walked over from Pier 39 to The a Ferry Building. We met up with his cousin, her husband and their adorable baby and had lunch at The Slanted Door. Good stuff.

His cousin took us for a drive around the city. We couldn't get into the Golden Gate Recreation area though because of the damn government shutdown again. We ended back at Fisherman's Wharf again and had dinner with his cousins, aunt, uncle, Chris and Rae. Bryan and I walked to Ghirardelli Square for dessert.

His aunt said we should go up to their house Thursday, so we did. They took us around to Sonoma wineries and to the beach. The beach was beautiful. Web don't have beaches like that in Jersey.

We had sandwiches for lunch at one of the wineries. I had a delicious eggplant sandwich. Of course we did a wine tasting :) Bryan didn't like any of them. We ate dinner in their downtown area and had the best French fries ever.

His aunt had some home videos from when Bryan was little. We watched little Bryan and he took the videos back to convert to DVD. He was very happy to have some video of when he was little.

Friday we went to Half Moon Bay, walked around the beach and then the downtown area there. 

We went back to Mountain View and geeked out at the Computer History Museum. It was actually really cool. We learned what programmers do :p

We had dinner at a fancy Vietnamese place. I ordered Duck Duck Good and had mango panna cotta for dessert. Another yummy meal. We went back to Chris and Rae's and said goodbye.

Overall, a pretty great trip, mostly thanks to Bryan's family. Our hotel wasn't bad. They had free breakfast, apples and cookies. Their fitness center lacked free weights, but I did OK with the weight machines. 

The weather was beautiful all we and we thoroughly enjoyed the lack of bugs. We'll go back again some day :)",San Francisco,,,,,,

We had dinner at the place eye were supposed to go Saturday night, Rok Bistro, where you cook your food on a hot stone. It was really good. Rae got the kangaroo and we tried some, not bad. Dessert was definitely the highlight of the meal. S'mores fondue, omg.

We went into the city on Monday. Waked around Union Square, a big mall just like the malls here, and had lunch at a Thai place. We wanted dessert, so ewe waked to a highly rated gelato place in the North Beach area. Definitely an good as the gelato in Rome.

We went back to the hotel for a nap and then went over Chris and Rae's again to watch the series finale of Breaking Bad. Good ending.

Tuesday we went to the Intel museum and then ate lunch at Apple with Chris. Bryan and I got suchi and gelato. After lunch we headed over to Palo Alto and went shopping in the downtown area and then took a long walk to Stanford and saw the sculpture garden. I've now been to Harvard, Columbia and Stanford, but not Princeton even though it's the closest.

Wednesday we were meeting up with Bryan's family in the city. We got a little lost on the way there and ended up being forced over the Bay Bridge. In general, the driving sucked. We finally made it though and walked over from Pier 39 to The a Ferry Building. We met up with his cousin, her husband and their adorable baby and had lunch at The Slanted Door. Good stuff.

His cousin took us for a drive around the city. We couldn't get into the Golden Gate Recreation area though because of the damn government shutdown again. We ended back at Fisherman's Wharf again and had dinner with his cousins, aunt, uncle, Chris and Rae. Bryan and I walked to Ghirardelli Square for dessert.

His aunt said we should go up to their house Thursday, so we did. They took us around to Sonoma wineries and to the beach. The beach was beautiful. Web don't have beaches like that in Jersey.

We had sandwiches for lunch at one of the wineries. I had a delicious eggplant sandwich. Of course we did a wine tasting :) Bryan didn't like any of them. We ate dinner in their downtown area and had the best French fries ever.

His aunt had some home videos from when Bryan was little. We watched little Bryan and he took the videos back to convert to DVD. He was very happy to have some video of when he was little.

Friday we went to Half Moon Bay, walked around the beach and then the downtown area there. 

We went back to Mountain View and geeked out at the Computer History Museum. It was actually really cool. We learned what programmers do :p

We had dinner at a fancy Vietnamese place. I ordered Duck Duck Good and had mango panna cotta for dessert. Another yummy meal. We went back to Chris and Rae's and said goodbye.

Overall, a pretty great trip, mostly thanks to Bryan's family. Our hotel wasn't bad. They had free breakfast, apples and cookies. Their fitness center lacked free weights, but I did OK with the weight machines. 

The weather was beautiful all we and we thoroughly enjoyed the lack of bugs. We'll go back again some day :)",San Francisco,,,,,,

11/4/2013 20:26,11/5/2013 1:26,"I guess I should blog since I haven't in quite a while.

Last weekend, Bryan took me to downtown Princeton on the way to Brian's since I had never been. I love looking around those little shops. Always overpriced, but once in a while you find something you can't live without.

Afterwards, we helped Brian paint his new house. I wasn't as bad at painting as I thought I would be. I make an awful mess when I cook, I figured I would get paint all over the place. Nope, mostly just on me.

Work has sucked a little lately. I have this never ending project to code this feature that's only a temporary fix. It was really hard, but not in a, well, at least I learned a lot, way. It was hard in a, how the hell do you run this stupid thing, sort of way. So, a lot if work, an insane amount if time, many headaches, all for very little reward. The stupid thing finally works and now I just have to deal with code review items and about a thousand (not even exaggerating) account configuration changes to make. 

Halloween wasn't bad. I reused last year's costume that didn't get much use due to Sandy. I don't know why more people don't dress up at work. When else can you be a fairy at work, really. I didn't win best costume, or more creative costume or funniest costume though. So wrong. 

This past Saturday I went to Justine's birthday party at this Polynesian place with karaoke. After I sang Part of Your World, some random stranger came up to me and requested I sing Somewhere Over the Rainbow. I guess the dude was a big Judy Garland fan. The DJ had trouble finding it, so I didn't get to sing it before he left. I think the highlight of the evening was Julia's cake. She's getting good at those.",Flippin' Your Fins You Don't Get Too Far,,,,,,

The summer after my grandma died, I somehow convinced my parents that we needed another dog to keep Princess company. My mom and I looked at shelter dogs online and then went to the shelter ""just to look."" We each picked out a dog. My mom wanted to get this old golden retriever, my dad liked a dog named Guinness, but the comments said she was aggressive.  I walked up and down the aisles and finally came to Buffy's cage. She was one of the dogs we saw online. She ran up to the bars and started licking my hand. 

<center><img src=""http://silvercpu.com/zenphoto/albums/2006/Ellen_Bday/P1010086.jpg"" alt=""Buffy"" /></center>

We went home to pick up Princess to make sure the dogs would be OK together. When we got back, someone else was looking at Buffy, but we saw her first ;) She and Princess basically ignored each other, so we took that as a good sign and brought her home. Princess was completely silent the whole way back, she had never been that calm in the car before.

After a few weeks living with us, they started fighting, and continued to fight until Princess was too old. Princess couldn't pay anymore without Buffy jumping in and trying to play too and Princess refused to play with her. Buffy would dangle toys in her face, try to force them into her mouth, but <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=70"">Princess would just smack her, starting a fight</a>. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1882"">Buffy did get mad at Princess sometimes</a>, usually when she was stressed out about something and she'd attack her. Poor Princess would get scared and angry. One of her little quirks. We think her living in the shelter for three months made her a little crazy. She had a ""hot spot"" on her back. She would spend hours scratching herself on the tree in the backyard. Also very Buffy was how she freaked out when anyone hugged. Probably because she thought hugs meant goodbye.

Deep down, <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1882"">Princess loved Buffy</a> and Buffy definitely loved Princess. Buffy thought she was alpha, but all of her confidence came from Princess. Buffy was awfully depressed when Princess died. The first time we picked her up from the groomers a black lab was there being groomed and my mom and I started crying when we saw her. The groomer said Buffy did the same thing. 

We also noticed she had lost her hearing at some point. Something that was masked since she always followed her sister around. She became more and more afraid of everything. Little dogs, kids, deer, bunnies. She'd turn and run the other way. She was bravest when the three of us were around to protect her.

The last few years she suffered from terrible arthritis that has gotten worse and worse. She loved to run, and even though her back legs gave out, it didn't seem to bother her. She ran until she couldn't even walk. Even last year were were still playing one of her favorite games: she'd chase me into the kitchen and then we'd turn around and I'd chase her into the blue bedroom, back send girth until we were tired. 

We hadn't been able to go for a walk in a while now, going to the bathroom and even eating had been a chore for her.

Last Thursday night I had a dream that I was over my parents' house and the vet was there to put Buffy to sleep. Once dream Buffy figured out what was going on, she started running around the backyard. It didn't really go that way.

Friday morning my mom called and told me Buffy collapsed the day before and still couldn't get up. I went up there early. She must have hurt her right front leg pretty badly because it seemed to really bother her. Unfortunately she couldn't get up with only three legs. I'd never seen her so frustrated and upset.

I stayed with her in the kitchen until she fell asleep. It was a rough few hours. She was whining and scrambling. I tried to help her up to pee, we took half a step before she collapsed again. I cleaned her off. She cried some more, I tried to comfort her. She finally exhausted herself and fell asleep. I slept on the couch in the next room in case she needed me.

She still couldn't get up in the morning, but at least she wasn't whining anymore. She slept most of the day. We dragged her outside one last time. We gave her a last meal of bacon and reces peanut butter cups. We brought her into the living room and sat with her. I told her she didn't have to worry about me going, it was Buffy's turn to go. 

The vet came at 5:30 to put her to sleep. I fed her peanut butter cups while they worked so she wouldn't know what was going on. She wouldn't eat the last crumble. We cried and said goodbye to her.

Buffy was so alert and aware of what was going on, it was heartbreaking. She had no concept of death, she just knew she hurt, she couldn't walk, and she didn't understand why. At least she doesn't have to hurt anymore and she's with her big sister now.",Buffy,,,,,,

Deep down, <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1882"">Princess loved Buffy</a> and Buffy definitely loved Princess. She followed her around, while still claiming to be alpha. One time they both escaped the backyard and Buffy followed Princess down to the elementary school. They were partners in crime.

Buffy was awfully depressed when Princess died. We also noticed she had lost her hearing at some point. She became more and more afraid of everything. Little dogs, kids, deer, bunnies. She'd turn and run the other way. The last couple of years she's suffered from terrible arthritis that has gotten worse and worse. Her back legs haven't worked in quite a while and going to the bathroom and even eating have been a chore for her.

Thursday night I had a dream that I was over my parents' house and the vet was there to put Buffy to sleep. Once dream Buffy figured out what was going on, she started running around the backyard. Our dream family decided to postpone the appointment 'till November 9th.

Friday morning my mom called and told me Buffy collapsed the day before and still couldn't get up. I went up there early.

This is surprisingly harder than when Princess died. In part because Buffy was so alert and aware of what was going on. Also I worried so much about Princess, it was almost a relief not to have to worry about her anymore. I had hoped Buffy would die peacefully in her sleep, but I think very few are that lucky.",Buffy,,,,,,

The summer after my grandma died, I somehow convinced my parents that we needed another dog to keep Princess company. My mom and I looked at shelter dogs online and then went to the shelter ""just to look."" We each picked out a dog. My mom wanted to get this old golden retriever, my dad liked a dog named Guinness, but the comments said she was aggressive.  I walked up and down the aisles and finally came to Buffy's cage. She was one of the dogs we saw online. She ran up to the bars and started licking my hand.

We went home to pick up Princess to make sure the dogs would be OK together. When we got back, someone else was looking at Buffy, but we saw her first ;) She and Princess basically ignored each other, so we took that as a good sign and brought her home. Princess was completely silent the whole way back, she had never been that calm in the car before.

After a few weeks living with us, they started fighting, and continued to fight until Princess was too old. Princess couldn't pay anymore without Buffy jumping in and trying to play too and Princess refused to play with her. Buffy would dangle toys in her face, try to force them into her mouth, but <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=70"">Princess would just smack her, starting a fight</a>. 

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1882"">Buffy did get mad at Princess sometimes</a>, usually when she was stressed out about something and she'd attack her. Poor Princess would get scared and angry. One of her little quirks. We think her living in the shelter for three months made her a little crazy. She had a ""hot spot"" on her back. She would spend hours scratching herself on the tree in the backyard. Also very Buffy was how she freaked out when anyone hugged. Probably because she thought hugs meant goodbye.

Deep down, <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1882"">Princess loved Buffy</a> and Buffy definitely loved Princess. Buffy thought she was alpha, but all of her confidence came from Princess. Buffy was awfully depressed when Princess died. The first time we picked her up from the groomers a black lab was there being groomed and my mom and I started crying when we saw her. The groomer said Buffy did the same thing. 

We also noticed she had lost her hearing at some point. Something that was masked since she always followed her sister around. She became more and more afraid of everything. Little dogs, kids, deer, bunnies. She'd turn and run the other way. The last couple of years she's suffered from terrible arthritis that has gotten worse and worse. Her back legs haven't worked in quite a while and going to the bathroom and even eating have been a chore for her.

Thursday night I had a dream that I was over my parents' house and the vet was there to put Buffy to sleep. Once dream Buffy figured out what was going on, she started running around the backyard. Our dream family decided to postpone the appointment 'till November 9th.

Friday morning my mom called and told me Buffy collapsed the day before and still couldn't get up. I went up there early. She must have hurt her right front leg pretty badly because it seemed to really bother her. Unfortunately she can't get up with only three legs. I'd never seen her so frustrated and upset.

I stayed with her in the kitchen until she fell asleep. It was a rough few hours. She was whining and scrambling. I tried to help her up to pee, we took half a step before she collapsed again. I cleaned her off. She cried some more, I tried to comfort her. She finally exhausted herself and fell asleep. I slept on the couch in the next room in case she needed me.

She still couldn't get up in the morning, but at least she wasn't whining anymore. She slept more of the day. We dragged her outside one last time. We gave her a last meal of bacon and reces peanut butter cups. We brought her into the living room and sat with her. I told her she didn't have to worry about me going, it was Buffy's turn to go. 

The vet came at 5:30 to put her to sleep. I fed her peanut butter cups while they worked so she wouldn't know what was going on. She wouldn't eat the last crumble. We cried and said goodbye to her.

This is surprisingly harder than when Princess died, or maybe I just don't remember how sad I was. Buffy was so alert and aware of what was going on. She had no concept of death, she just knew should hurt, she couldn't walk, and she didn't understand why.

I had a dream last night that they we're play fighting together.",Buffy,,,,,,

Last weekend, Bryan took me to downtown Princeton on the way to Brian's since I had never been. I love looking around those little shops. Always overpriced, but once in a while you find something you can't live without.

Afterwards, we helped Brian paint his new house. I wasn't as bad at painting as I thought I would be. I make an awful mess when I cook, I figured I would get paint all over the place. Nope, mostly just on me.

Work has sucked a little lately. I have this never ending project to code this feature that's only a temporary fix. It was really hard, but not in a, well, at least I learned a lot, way. It was hard in a, how the hell do you run this stupid thing, sort of way. So, a lot if work, an insane amount if time, many headaches, all for very little reward. The stupid thing finally works and now I just have to deal with code review items and about a thousand (not even exaggerating) account configuration changes to make. 

Halloween wasn't bad. I reused last year's costume that didn't get much use due to Sandy. I don't know why more people don't dress up at work. When else can you be a fairy at work, really. I didn't win best costume, or more creative costume or funniest costume though. So wrong. 

This past Saturday I went to Justine's birthday party at this Polynesian place with karaoke. After I sang Part of Your World, some random stranger came up to me and requested I sing Somewhere Over the Rainbow. I guess the dude was a big Judy Garland fan. The DJ had trouble finding it, so I didn't get to sing it before he left. I think the highlight of the evening was Julia's cake. She's getting good at those.",Flippin' Your Fins You Don't Get Too Far,,,,,,

Finally I picked out some athletic socks for $11 and called it a win.

Then I headed to the dollar store since it was on the way to Marshals. We need supplies for our EOY event at work. I only spend $4, but I must have been on line for 20 minutes.

I didn't have any luck at Marshals either. Not with dresses anyway. I think they had a total of three in my size and they were all incredibly ugly. It was then that I decided if I was going to look gorgeous, I had to stop being so cheap. I did buy some new yoga pants while I was and tights because you can never have enough tights.

Bryan and I had dinner at Uno's, spent a whopping $20 including tip and tax :P Yay coupons! Oh and we passed by the coming soon Seasons 52!!!! So excited! Had no idea they were opening one by us. *drool*

We went to the mall after and I walked into every store I have never been to before including Guess. Normally sales people freak me out, but I liked the lady that helped me there. She picked out a bunch of dresses in my size, which apparently is a 0 now due to size inflation, and brought in some heels for me to try on with the dresses. We had a winner:

Then Monday I had a flat tire :-/ So I had to work from home and I got all new tires. Tuesday, it snowed, so I worked from home again. Wednesday was the first day of my vacation and Bryan and I went to see The Hobbit. Thursday, Bryan and I met up with my coworkers for lunch at Fridays. 

Friday was Helen's birthday party at PF Chang's and we hung out at her apartment after, good times.

I've been hanging out with my parents since. We've seen many movies. The Conjuring was surprisingly good. The Heat wasn't. We saw Catching Fire yesterday, I think it was even better than the first movie. Today my mom and I watched 50/50, cute movie. 

Oh and Donna's rum cake came yesterday, so I didn't miss it this year :P

1996-1997:
Happy new yearâs eve. Iâm going to Jenâs house. We are eating at the Crab Shack. I was off from school.
My new yearâs resolution is to try to take a shower every day!

Well the straight As thing, only counts for mp III and IIII. Stay on the Principalâs list. thatâs easier. see ya next year! I can play âAuld Land Syneâ on my keyboard. Goodbye 1997! Hello 98!! Happy New Year!!

1998-1999:
Well, itâs that time of the year again, New Years eve. Itâs been since 8 minutes ago.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn&#039;t have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents&#039;. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian&#039;s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She&#039;s a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&#039;s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn&#039;t have a mortgage then. As long as we don&#039;t go crazy buying shit we don&#039;t need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the. New Black and Downton Abbey. 
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.",New Years Past,,,,,,

Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn&#039;t have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents&#039;. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian&#039;s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She&#039;s a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&#039;s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn&#039;t have a mortgage then. As long as we don&#039;t go crazy buying shit we don&#039;t need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the. New Black and Downton Abbey. 
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.",New Years Past,,,,,,

January 14, 2004
<blockquote>Lissy got her new phone!!! Turns out, as opposed to what Verizon said on a section of their site, it does not come with an extra battery which is dumb so my daddy gonna complain today. It not right for them to give the extra battery to some people and then just change their minds! Verizon poo heads. But anyway, Lissy lerve her phone :D It so cool! In the phonebook, it has places for all peoples different numbers so I donât have to make seperate entries and for each person, you can pick a little cartoon icon thing that shows up on the cover LCD display when they call :D And It has annimations for the front and inside screens and IT SO CUTE! Itâs half the size of the evil Kyocera phone I had before and itâs all silver which is a great color ;) And oh, I love it :) It was expensive, but, Christmas presie :P Actually, the lady there tried charging us an extra $50 because Iâm a secondary and not a primary line??? Where the frell did that come from??? So weâre like, well, thatâs dren, my daddy gonna complain bout that too. But I do love my phone :D I havenât downloaded anything yet cause I figured Iâll wait âtill after the 15 day trial period incase I wanna give it back. Stupid to pay for ringtones and stuff if Iâm only gonna use them for 15 days, but I doubt Iâll be giving the phone back. I was thinking about it after the whole battery thing, but then I used the phone. Lissy no give phone back, lol. Not unless it dies on me or something.
40 more minutes until my fav episode of Sliders is on :D Iâm so glad Sci-Fiâs rerunning eps again. Course this means I canât eat breakfast or lunch while Iâm at school, but I figured Iâll have a slimfast shake or something in the morning. No biggie :P Oh and yesterday, I figured out how to work the timer on my VCR! Yeah, only took me 8 years. Turns out the TV has to be off  which is weird because it usually wonât let you record if the TVâs off, but whatever, it worksâ¦ just wish I figured it out soonerâ¦ If I ever go to the mall, I have to buy more blank tapes. I really wish Sliders would come out on DVD, I hate having to tape everything. Right now I only have like 10 episodes and I ran out of tape boxes 
edit: I uploaded my schedule for next semester which starts the 20th. So, now you can see where I am at all times! I know, how exciting :P HTML Format | Gif Format (recomended)</blockquote>

Saturday we hung out at home, cooked. I spent the day looking through my old website files to help me answer some questions for a survey. I was so incredibly obnoxious!

We also had a treat from Maryam who brought meatballs into work for me because that's how awesome she is. Everyone LOVED the meatballs. And the peppers. I made up the pepper recipe since I didn't have any recipes in my arsenal that were gluten free, dairy free, and not similar to the soup. It's pretty simple, but came out really good.

South-western stuffed peppers:
Six peppers, sliced in half
2 jalopeanos
A yellow onion
Garlic 
A cup or so of salsa
Ground beef
Can of corn
Can of black beans
Chili powder
Cumin

I mixed and cooked everything and filled the pepper halves. Put some cheese on top. Baked for 30 minutes at 350 and then broiled on high for about five minutes. So yummy. Prefer this over my slow cooker stuffed peppers.

<span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">I did a lot of research on getting pregnant, really a lot. I am now an expert on my cycle and ovulation. I didn't want to read too much about pregnancy before hand, mostly because there's a lot about pregnancy I still don't want to know, but I've still researched a bit and knew basics on nutrition, exercise, doctor visits, etc. Once I found out I was pregnant, I immediately began reading everything I could on the first trimester. Here are the list of things I've learned through my experiences so far that surprised me the most:</span>

You are two weeks along before you're even pregnant. Because they start counting weeks from the date of your last period and you normally ovulate about 2 weeks after your period, by the time sperm meets egg, your baby is already 2 weeks. &lt;-- This is really stupid for two reasons. 1: Your period does not dictate your ovulation date. The cycle before my last one, I ovulated on day 23. The cycle we conceived it was day 16. If I had ovulated on day 23 of this cycle, going by this stupid method, everything would have been off by a week. 2: The baby doesn't exist before conception, it just doesn't.

Aversions. We all know about food cravings and aversions, I just didn't realize how strong the aversions would be and how early on. I really love food, like it's my favorite. All the food. Eating, starting around week 6 has been very difficult. I bought these brown rice crackers because I thought they would be great for morning sickness. They were really yummy in week 5, couldn't even look at them in week 6. I love dried cranberries - can't even think about dried cranberries without feeling sick. I keep forcing myself to eat salads. Most surprising - I don't want sweets! What??? They make me sick. Even sweet potato stuffed pasta :( I am loving carrots, milk, veggie sushi, ginger salad dressing,Â fruit, oatmeal, and basically anything Bryan cooks. Eating out has been a challenge as most restaurant food is heavy and doesn't agree with me.

Diarrhea - 'nuff said.

Cramps. I was expecting nausea and heartburn, but not the scary cramps! My doctor as well as Doctor Google says cramps are completely normal. They're not very painful, but they do feel like your period's coming which is terrifying when you're scared to death of seeing blood when you go to the bathroom.

Miscarriages are so common! And there's nothing you can do to prevent them really because the majority are due to chromosomal defects. As high as 75% chance of a miscarriage before a pregnancy is detected/missed period. Chemical pregnancies, a miscarriage before week 6 happens in about 25-30% of pregnancies. Once you hear the baby's heartbeat (6-8 weeks), the chance of miscarriage greatly decreases to about 3%. Miscarriages after 12 weeks is much less common which is why folks usually wait until the second trimester to announce their pregnancies. Yes, I read a lot about miscarriages, but mostly because I found the statistics comforting - at any point after the 4 weeks, it was more likely to stick than not and the odds increased every day.

Oh the anxiety. I'm a control freak, so having no control over what's going on in my body has been driving me mad. I haven't had many mood swings, unusual for me actually, but I've been ten times more anxious than normal and I'm normally a pretty anxious person. Driving is so much scarier. So is Toastmasters. I haven't been good about going to Toastmasters.

You can't eat smoked salmon - had no idea.

Peeing a lot starts early. This was actually my first sign I was pregnant. I went off the pill last April and it took six months for me to get my period back and even then, I had a short luteal phase, not good for baby making because the egg needs time to implant. My period had been showing up on day 10-11 of my cycle and when my period didn't come by day 13, I figured my luteal phase was just getting back to normal after the pill. Then I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and, by golly, I peed a lot. I thought, yeah, I'm totally pregnant. My positive test in the morning confirmed it.",Pregnancy is Weird,,,,,,

Unfortunately our first ultrasound experience was a little less than magical. It was all good news, we saw the heartbeat, everything was perfectly fine. The technician sucked. She wasn't mean or rude or anything, just very cold. She acted like she was in a big rush and we were inconveniencing her. Basically she ordered me to get undressed and get on the table and without any warning, she sticks the wand, you know, up there. If I didn't know that's how they did early ultrasounds I would have been traumatized. Bryan had no idea that's what she was doing to me. I said, yeah, that's why I looked extremely uncomfortable.

She points out the baby, says that's the heartbeat, it's 153, that's normal, OK, now I'm going to take measurements ... please move your leg, ok, and we're done here, put your clothes on, wait outside, they'll call you. It was over in about a minute. Everyone was asking me if I cried ... I didn't really have time. Still very cool to see this living thing inside of me and such a relief. Also a relief that there was only one :)

The doctor was pretty cool. We laughed about how ridiculous the vitamin industry is. We got a bunch of pamphlets and samples and they took ALL OF MY BLOOD. If I had to sit there any longer with the needle in my arm I was going to start freaking out. That was definitely the worst part. It didn't hurt at all, I have really great veins, but golly they took a lot of blood. But I survived, didn't pass out or anything :)

We told people the good news when we got home. Then I find out there's an opening for a STTL position in our org. Really? Now? Aren't there enough changes going on in my life? I guess I have to apply, otherwise it'll look bad, but I don't think it's something I want right now.",The First Ultrasound,,,,,,

Unfortunately our first ultrasound experience was a little less than magical. It was all good news, we saw the heartbeat, everything was perfectly fine. The technician sucked. She wasn't mean or rude or anything, just very cold. She acted like she was in a big rush and we were inconveniencing her. Basically she ordered me to get undressed and get on the table and without any warning, she sticks the wand, you know, up there. If I didn't know that's how they did early ultrasounds I would have been traumatized. Bryan had no idea that's what she was doing to me. I said, yeah, that's why I looked extremely uncomfortable.

She points out the baby, says that's the heartbeat, it's 153, that's normal, OK, now I'm going to take measurements ... please move your leg, ok, and we're done here, put your clothes on, wait outside, they'll call you. It was over in about a minute. Everyone was asking me if I cried ... I didn't really have time. Still very cool to see this living thing inside of me and such a relief. Also a relief that there was only one :)

2/28/2014 17:50,2/28/2014 22:50,"My goal was to see Frozen before going to Disney World again and we accomplished this last weekend thanks to Julia. That is great movie. Bryan and I had the same thought: George Lucas should take notes. Olaf: how to do a cute, comedy relief character correctly, Jar Jar: not so much. We also went out for Japanese food and frozen yogurt too :D

That was Sunday, Saturday we went out to dinner with Bryan's family again. His aunt and cousin were visiting and Nana took us all to the same fancy Italian restaurant. Tried the Salmon this time - yum! Ended up taking the steak home by accident, but that was also yum :D

I was very busy at work this week. One of those times where everything exploded at once. I expect to be just as busy for the majority of March.

And I'm sick, but I'm already feeling a little better. That was probably the spicy stew though. Oh how my sinuses love spicy food.","Elissa Ann, Meet Elsa and Anna",,,,,,

Now that I've given that a second to sink in, our trip recap: We arrived late Saturday afternoon and didn't have time to checkin at the hotel before our dinner reservation, so we met up with my aunt and my cousin at Yachtsman. We told them the good news before we ordered since I couldn't eat most of the food on the menu. Well, I could, but steak well done? Why bother. My fish was good, but the truffle mac and cheese, omg.

Sunday we went to Hollywood studios. The magic bands and fastpass+ seem to work pretty well, except we waited over a half hour to get on the great movie ride which almost never has a line. For some reason they only had one side operating. Due to the wait, we missed the first Fantasmic show, but caught the much less crowded second show. Oh and we finally got our picture with the Penguin! Dinner was at SciFi.

Monday was our epic Anna and Elsa wait. We got there 40 minutes before the park opened, we got on the line seven minutes after opening and we were told the wait was already two and a half hours. We didn't think it would actually be that long. Turns out it was actually three hours. It went by really quickly though. We were joking with the other folks in line, got to sit a lot of the wait, the weather was lovely. The wait and the meet and greet was actually one of my favorite parts of the trip.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" alt=""1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o-1024x952.jpg"" width=""540"" height=""502"" /></a>

Only downside is we were late for our Via Napoli lunch. We spent the rest of the afternoon touring everyone around future world. Dinner was at Mexico.

Tuesday, the Animal Kingdom was supposed to be the best park to visit, crowd level wise, but it was Mardi Gras and it seemed like the entire population of Louisiana was in the park. I had never seen the Animal Kingdom that crowded. We had fastpasses for all the headliners, unfortunately, you aren't supposed to ride any of them if you're pregnant. I went on Kilimanjaro anyway. I don't know why that one isn't OK. Driving over the potholes in a NJ are worse. Lunch was at Yak and Yeti and our delicious dinner was at Jiko.

Wednesday we finally made our way to the Magic Kingdom. I was expecting epic crowds based on the day before, but it wasn't bad. My morning sickness wasn't so good though. This was our biggest food day and I was worried I wouldn't be able to eat, but the nausea seems to subside right before it's eating time and then comes back with a vengeance a few hours after dinner.

Bryan and I got to the park at rope drop and did Little Mermaid, Tiki Room and the Riverboat before lunch at Liberty Tree. Once again, my favorite meal of the trip. I changed our fastpasses for Haunted Mansion on the fly when we saw it was only a 15 minute wait and got us ones for Jungle Cruise instead. After hitting all the major attractions, we headed over to The Contemporary for dinner at The California Grill.

The food there is always exceptional, though also seems to be a bit over seasoned. I had the sweet potato gnocchi which tasted a lot better on the way down than the way back up :-/ After dinner, Bryan, Jon and I headed back to the MK for the projection show and fireworks. Very excited to see Frozen was added to the projection show. Also glad Jon got to see the fireworks his last night.

Thursday it was raining. Eh, has to happen once every few years, just glad it was on a day we didn't have anything planned. We went to Holywood Studios, saw Beauty and the Beast and attempted to see the Lights, Motors, Action Stunt Show, but, it was cancelled half way through due to the rain.

After Toy Story Mania, and beating Bryan's score for the second time this trip, we headed back to the hotel, at which point, it of course stopped raining. We rested a bit and then left for Downtown Disney. We shopped around and had dinner at Raglan Road.

Friday Bryan and I made rope drop at the. Magic Kingdom again which let us ride Peter Pan with a minimal wait. We met up with my parents, and Donna, another cousin, for breakfast at Crystal Palace where we fulfilled our dream of getting our picture with Piglet.

Trying to coordinate our fastpasses with Donna's offsite ticket proved impossible. I could scan her ticket into the MDE app, but it wouldn't let me make selections for her. We waited at a fastpass kiosk, but the guy was only able to get her the same time for our Little Mermaid fastpass. Lines were longer than the other day, but still not awful and my mom and I didn't go on Thunder Mountain anyway, so Donna used our fastpass for that.

One of the longer waits was getting into Be Our Guest for dinner, even though we had reservations. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so cold. It got pretty chilly that night. We got to sit in the West Wing though which was neat. Dinner was good, though I was very sick later on. Yup, I thew up ""the grey stuff.""

Our last day was spent at Epcot where the Flower and Garden Festival had just begun. Getting there early was a very good idea. No one was around in the morning and we enjoyed the exhibits mostly to ourselves. We also spent a good portion of the morning at The Seas enjoying manatees and dolphins.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10003596_10103613531790209_1667518570_o.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" alt=""10003596_10103613531790209_1667518570_o"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/10003596_10103613531790209_1667518570_o-1024x926.jpg"" width=""540"" height=""488"" /></a>

We made lunch out of the festival food kiosks. I enjoyed my sweet potato waffle with pineapple dole whip :) The Spring Pancake in China was also very good. We shopped our way around the countries, heard the Voices of Liberty, took a nap at The American Adventure.

By mid afternoon it was very crowded and we were glad we had accomplished everything we wanted to already. Except Maelstrom. We had fastpasses, because apparently that's necessary for Maelstrom now, but when we walked by at 2, they were closed :0 fortunately, by the time our fastpass window came around, they were back in operation again :D Yay, trolls!

By 4:00, it was too crowded to move around, so we left the park a little early and got some water back in the room. Dinner was at the always amazing Il Mulino in the Swan. As good as Disney service is, I feel like it's always a few steps above there, as well as food quality. Of course they have the same restaurant in NY so we could really eat there anytime...

Bryan had dessert at Beaches and Cream. I had pink lemonade because I didn't want to get sick again. I had heartburn instead.

And now we're home, back in gloomy NJ :( That's always the worst part of Disney: leaving.",Disney World 2014,,,,,,

We waited at a fastpass kiosk, but the guy was only able to get her the same time for our Little Mermaid fastpass. Lines were longer than the other day, but still not awful and my mom and I didn't go on Thunder Mountain anyway, so Donna used our fastpass for that.

One of the longer waits was getting into Be Our Guest for dinner, even though we had reservations. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so cold. It got pretty chilly that night. We got to sit in the West Wing though which was neat. Dinner was good, though I was very sick later on. Yup, I thew up ""the grey stuff.""

Our last day was spent at Epcot where the Flower and Garden Festival had just begun. Getting there early was a very good idea. No one was around in the morning and we enjoyed the exhibits mostly to ourselves. We also spent a good portion of the morning at The Seas enjoying manatees and dolphins.

We made lunch out of the festival food kiosks. I enjoyed my sweet potato waffle with pineapple dole whip :) The Spring Pancake in China was also very good. We shopped our way around the countries, heard the Voices of Liberty, took a nap at The American Adventure.

By mid afternoon it was very crowded and we were glad we had accomplished everything we wanted to already. Except Maelstrom. We had fastpasses, because apparently that's necessary for Maelstrom now, but when we walked by at 2, they were closed :0 fortunately, by the time our fastpass window came around, they were back in operation again :D Yay, trolls!

By 4:00, it was too crowded to move around, so we left the park a little early and got some water back in the room. Dinner was at the always amazing Il Mulino in the Swan. As good as Disney serviceis, I feel like it's always a few steps above there, as well as food quality. Of course they have the same restaurant in NY so we could really eat there any time...

Bryan had dessert at Beaches and Cream. I had pink lemonade because I didn't want to get sick again. I had heartburn instead.

And now we're home, back in gloomy NJ :( That's always the worst part of Disney: leaving.",Disney World 2014,,,,,,

Now that I've given that a second to sink in, our trip recap: We arrived late Saturday afternoon and didn't have time to checkin at the hotel before our dinner reservation, so we met up with my aunt and my cousin at Yachtsman. We told them the good news before we ordered since I couldn't eat most of the food on the menu. Well, I could, but steak well done? Why bother. My fish was good, but the truffle mac and cheese, omg.

Sunday we went to Hollywood studios. The magic bands and fastpass+ seem to work pretty well, except we waited over a half hour to get on the great movie ride which almost never has a line. For some reason they only had one side operating. Due to the wait, we missed the first Fantasmic show, but caught the much less crowded second show. Oh and we finally got our picture with the Penguin! Dinner was at SciFi.

Monday was our epic Anna and Elsa wait. We got there 40 minutes before the park opened, we got on the line seven minutes after opening and we were told the wait was already two and a half hours. We didn't think it would actually be that long. Turns out it was actually three hours. It went by really quickly though. We were joking with the other folks in line, got to sit a lot of the wait, the weather was lovely. The wait and the meet and greet was actually one of my favorite parts of the trip.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" alt=""1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/1966045_10103613424969279_1498969492_o-1024x952.jpg"" width=""540"" height=""502"" /></a>

Only downside is we were late for our Via Napoli lunch. We spent the rest of the afternoon touring everyone around future world. Dinner was at Mexico.

Tuesday, the Animal Kingdom was supposed to be the best park to visit, crowd level wise, but it was Mardi Gras and it seemed like the entire population of Louisiana was in the park. I had never seen the Animal Kingdom that crowded. We had fastpasses for all the headliners, unfortunately, you aren't supposed to ride any of them if you're pregnant. I went on Kilimanjaro anyway. I don't know why that one isn't OK. Driving over the potholes in a NJ are worse. Lunch was at Yak and Yeti and our delicious dinner was at Jiko.

Wednesday we finally made our way to the Magic Kingdom. I was expecting epic crowds based on the day before, but it wasn't bad. My morning sickness wasn't so good though. This was our biggest food day and I was worried I wouldn't be able to eat, but the nausea seems to subside right before it's eating time and then comes back with a vengeance a few hours after dinner.

Bryan and I got to the park at rope drop and did Little Mermaid, Tiki Room and the Riverboat before lunch at Liberty Tree. Once again, my favorite meal of the trip. I changed our fastpasses for Haunted Mansion on the fly when we saw it was only a 15 minute wait and got us ones for Jungle Cruise instead. After hitting all the major attractions, we headed over to The Contemporary for dinner at The California Grill.

The food there is always exceptional, though also seems to be a bit over seasoned. I had the sweet potato gnocchi which tasted a lot better on the way down than the way back up :-/ After dinner, Bryan, Jon and I headed back to the MK for the projection show and fireworks. Very excited to see Frozen was added to the projection show. Also glad Jon got to see the fireworks his last night.

Thursday it was raining. Eh, has to happen once every few years, just glad it was on a day we didn't have anything planned. We went to Holywood Studios, saw Beauty and the Beast and attempted to see the Lights, Motors, Action Stunt Show, but, it was cancelled half way through due to the rain.

After Toy Story Mania, and beating Bryan's score for the second time this trip, we headed back to the hotel, at which point, it of course stopped raining. We rested a bit and then left for Downtown Disney. We shopped around and had dinner at Raglan Road.

3/26/2014 11:56,3/26/2014 15:56,"Warning, TMI ahead!

<span style=""line-height: 1.5em;"">I did a lot of research on getting pregnant, really a lot. I am now an expert on my cycle and ovulation. I didn't want to read too much about pregnancy before hand, mostly because there's a lot about pregnancy I still don't want to know, but I've still researched a bit and knew basics on nutrition, exercise, doctor visits, etc. Once I found out I was pregnant, I immediately began reading everything I could on the first trimester. Here are the list of things I've learned through my experiences so far that surprised me the most:</span>

You are two weeks along before you're even pregnant. Because they start counting weeks from the date of your last period and you normally ovulate about 2 weeks after your period, by the time sperm meets egg, your baby is already 2 weeks. &lt;-- This is really stupid for two reasons. 1: Your period does not dictate your ovulation date. The cycle before my last one, I ovulated on day 23. The cycle we conceived it was day 16. If I had ovulated on day 23 of this cycle, going by this stupid method, everything would have been off by a week. 2: The baby doesn't exist before conception, it just doesn't.

Aversions. We all know about food cravings and aversions, I just didn't realize how strong the aversions would be and how early on. I really love food, like it's my favorite. All the food. Eating, starting around week 6 has been very difficult. I bought these brown rice crackers because I thought they would be great for morning sickness. They were really yummy in week 5, couldn't even look at them in week 6. I love dried cranberries - can't even think about dried cranberries without feeling sick. I keep forcing myself to eat salads. Most surprising - I don't want sweets! What??? They make me sick. Even sweet potato stuffed pasta :( I am loving carrots, milk, veggie sushi, ginger salad dressing,Â fruit, oatmeal, and basically anything Bryan cooks. Eating out has been a challenge as most restaurant food is heavy and doesn't agree with me.

Diarrhea - 'nuff said.

Cramps. I was expecting nausea and heartburn, but not the scary cramps! My doctor as well as Doctor Google says cramps are completely normal. They're not very painful, but they do feel like your period's coming which is terrifying when you're scared to death of seeing blood when you go to the bathroom.

Miscarriages are so common! And there's nothing you can do to prevent them really because the majority are due to chromosomal defects. As high as 75% chance of a miscarriage before a pregnancy is detected/missed period. Chemical pregnancies, a miscarriage before week 6 happens in about 25-30% of pregnancies. Once you hear the baby's heartbeat (6-8 weeks), the chance of miscarriage greatly decreases to about 3%. Miscarriages after 12 weeks is much less common which is why folks usually wait until the second trimester to announce their pregnancies. Yes, I read a lot about miscarriages, but mostly because I found the statistics comforting - at any point after the 4 weeks, it was more likely to stick than not and the odds increased every day.

Oh the anxiety. I'm a control freak, so having no control over what's going on in my body has been driving me mad. I haven't had many mood swings, unusual for me actually, but I've been ten times more anxious than normal and I'm normally a pretty anxious person. Driving is so much scarier. So is Toastmasters. I haven't been good about going to Toastmasters.

You can't eat smoked salmon - had no idea.

Peeing a lot starts early. This was actually my first sign I was pregnant. I went off the pill last April and it took six months for me to get my period back and even then, I had a short luteal phase, not good for baby making because the egg needs time to implant. My period had been showing up on day 10-11 of my cycle and when my period didn't come by day 13, I figured my luteal phase was just getting back to normal after the pill. Then I woke up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and, by golly, I peed a lot. I thought, yeah, I'm totally pregnant. My positive test in the morning confirmed it.",Pregnancy is Weird,,,,,,

Worried I got my ovulation date wrong, worried that wasn't really a line I saw on the pregnancy test. Worried I'll wake up tomorrow bleeding. Ovulation happened a lots earlier this month, less stress, maca powder, less exercise? Surprised us and we only got one bd in before and one after. Guess it was enough. Hope the pregnancy sticks, but if not, at least we know we can get pregnant.",Baby maybe?,,,,,,

This might have been the longest I've gone without posting. I was doing to do another Day in the Life, but I haven't found a good day yet. Maybe next week.

Today was my 16 week checkup that I was late for since I had to clean snow off my car (wtf?). So far, I've lost five pounds and gained it back again. Everything looks good. They took my blood to test for spina bifida. It hurt! Usually it doesn't hurt when they take my blood. I don't know if it was the nurse or I'm extra sensitive today, but it wasn't pleasant.

My tummy has definitely gotten bigger and most of my clothes no longer fit. The nausea and fatigue have eased up, whoot! I can make it through a whole day without a nap, but I'm still going to bed early and falling asleep as soon as my head hits the pillow. Gas is still a problem, but gas has always been a problem for me, not being able to burp.

I finally got my appetite back, though I still don't want anything to do with dried cranberries and sweets still aren't as appealing as they were pre-pregnancy. I'm loving cheeseburgers Â with ketchup, lots of ketchup, though I'm trying to limit my burger intake to about twice a month, and peanut butter and jelly. Salad also, but not my usual salads. I seem to have regressed to my childhood when carrots, croutons and creamy dressing were my thing. Don't worry, I put greens, beans and other healthy stuff on there too.

Sunday was a terrible day. Something bad happened to one of my friends and I was a mess. My friend is OK physically, been trying to give her emotional support, though it's not exactly my forte. Hope I helped a little. I don't want friends to hurt :( Life aint fair sometimes.",16 Weeks,,,,,,

5:10am
You had dreams about HS choir, hadn't had one of those in a while. And sidewalk chalk? You think you feel your fitbit buzzing, nope, way too early. You take a sip of water and use your saline nasal spray. You roll back over onto your left side and go back to sleep.

6:05am
Still too early. You try going back to sleep. You fail. You're hungry. You don't know why since you felt uncomfortably stuffed last night. You decide to get up early. You turn off the fan and air filter. You grab your cellphone and your cup of water, put them down on the bathroom sink. You hear Bryan in the kitchen downstairs while you put on your robe and socks. You head downstairs for breakfast, Bryan has disappeared back into the basement. You heat up a glass of water. You eat part of your strawberry-banana overnight oats. You check Facebook, no new Lyra pictures yet :( You check your email and the pregnancy app to see today's tip while you drink your water.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_061501.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4560"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_061501-225x300.jpg"" alt=""20140423_061501"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

6:30am
Your fitbit alarm goes off. You go upstairs to the bathroom, put in your contacts, brush your teeth, put on your workout clothes and head back down. Bryan comes up, hugs you, and informs you he was reading about the baby. It has hiccups and can blink. He goes upstairs to sleep. You weigh yourself before going down into the basement, 107.8, and record it in your pregnancy app. Today is the best workout of the week - prenatal yoga. Oh the stretchy goodness.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4561"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800-225x300.jpg"" alt=""20140423_064800"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

After yoga, you grab another bite of your breakfast and then head upstairs to shower. You wash your hair, wash your body, shave, wash your face and longer a little too long under the nice, warm water. You need more conditioner. Maybe you'll go to Target after work. You always say that, you never do. Maybe you will today since you have witnesses. You finally step out and dry yourself off. You put lotion and makeup on, comb and towel dry your hair and belly butter-up. You practice your next toastmasters speech as you get ready. You get dressed and head downstairs.

8:15am
Wow, you woke up early and you might actually leave early, that never happens. You take your vitamins, grab your breakfast and lunch from the fridge, gather up the rest of your stuff and head out. You wear your wool coat today since it's supposed to be a little chilly. You buckle yourself in with your Dream Baby Bump Belt.

(This was written after I arrived at work. Never text and drive!) The radio says there was an accident on the Parkway, but it was just North of you, so it should be OK. You've been taking the Parkway because they're doing crazy construction on 35. Hmm, right lane, left lane? You pick the left lane. Whoot, good choice, that also never happens! There's a truck in the right. You speed past everyone stuck behind the truck, muahaha. On the Parkway you slow down to let the crazy person go in front of you. And now the dudeÂ behind you is tailgating. You go over to the middle lane. They're talking to the guy from ""My Cat From Hell"" on the radio - good show. He's funny. Almost to work. Wow, does this person realize there are two lanes here? Don't bother checking to see if there's someone in the other lane, why would you do that? Oh, is he going to get over again? Yup, yup, look at that, and didn't check the other lane again. I would honk if I were that other car. Â Of course they're turning into at&amp;t.

8:55am
You park in the parking garage and take the elevatorÂ up to your office. You can carry the laptop or the baby up the stairs, but not both. You plug in your laptop and finish your breakfast as you check your email. Nitika comes in, you say good morning. SheÂ jokes, ""did you go home?"" ""Right after you."" You go put your food in the fridge and fill your water bottle. You squeeze in some lemon juice. You're cold. Probably will end up keeping your coat on all day again. You hear bagel day in full swing down the hall. You review I-Hsiung's updated HLD and send your updated estimate to Hsiu-Mei. You hear Maryam shuffle into Nitika's office, you go over to visit too. NitikaÂ asks how ""mommy's doing."" You're cold.

Potty break. On the way, you stop by Maryam's office because Bushra is there and Sumayya and Merzia come over too. You grab Nitika. Maryam is teasing one of them about being next to get pregnant. You happen to know she's already pregnant and she finally announces it! You won't say who since she wants to keep it just between yourÂ group for now. Anthony and Mark come over because they hear your giggling. YouÂ all chat for a while. Anthony thinks you're having a boy, Nitika thinks it's a girl.Â The party breaks up and you complete your journey to the bathroom.

Rocky emails you the workforce management graphic to upload to their tSpace community. It doesn't want to upload. You save it as a different file format, that works for some reason. Ting wants to submit the code into the repository today, so you check to make sure you've named your files correctly as you've changed them like three times already because, um, pregnancy makes you dyslexic? You realize you never approved Rich's document because Prism was down, oops. You go do that now.

11am
You're hungry. Lunch time! You go heat up your food. Someone left a paper towel in the sink? There's no reason for that. You check Facebook. You have a message from Greg (yup, same Candadian Greg) left from yourÂ conversation last night. You had no idea he had a baby. You hadn't talked in a while. You also have a message from Helen working out dinner plans in a couple weeks. The microwave dings. Yumm, Bryan's chili. This should warm you up. You make your ""walk?"" times poll while you eat. You have no meeting today besides this optional brown bag on the new mobile share plans, should be easy to schedule for you. Oh, right, that's jalapeno, not green pepper, hot, hot, very hot. Well, that'll clear out your sinuses. Only one tissue left :(

Kushal comes by with a chocolate egg for you that he got from Phyllis. He had too many already. Yip, dessert. People are not voting in your poll. Manjula says she can only go at 2:30. Nitika wants to know if your internet is slow. Not that you've noticed. People voted. You message the group informing them of walks at 12:30 and 4:30 today. There's an after work get together at Bonefish today that you won't be going to. Not as much fun when you can't drink.

Julia wants to know if you're going to have a reveal cake with pink or blue inside. You say yes, an ice cream cake, but you need help with the cake part. Anthony mentioned earlierÂ he's learning JavaScript, so you message and ask how since it's something you need to pick up as well. He sends you a <a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/#How_NOT_To_Learn_JavaScript"">url</a>. The workforce management people are very happy with their tSpace - huzzah! OK, now your internet is slow. Since you can't do much, you decide to join the first half of the brown bag. You check your wireless account and it says it hasn't been paid yet. You call your dad to make sure switching plans didn't mess up any autopay he had setup. Anthony asks what else is on your list to learn. You're mostly focusing on mobile development stuff since you have to learn one of the strategic areas by EOY. Hmm, should you buy the kindle book or wait for the paperback in the mail. Kindle book you can start with now. It's expensive :(

12:30pm
You grab the girls for your walk, but Nitika's on the phone and Merzia is still eating, so you wait a bit. The four of you walk down. Coming back from your first round, you run into Maryam who has a little time before her next meeting. At the end of the walk, you stop by the vendors. Maryam has to go back upstairs. There's a very good lamp salesman who talks the four of you into buying almost $200 worth of lamps. You get <a href=""http://www.lampofaroma.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PI-060"">yours </a>for the cheapest since you didn't really want one. Peer pressure. Yiding walks by as you're browsing and you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the counts for October and probably we won't have to modify them at all for the clfi change.

You take the elevator back up to your offices. Your mom called when you were on your walk, so you call back. She was looking at diapers and strollers and will send you links. You tell her you're coming home this weekend. You check and see if you have an email about your room assignment for Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, but you don't see one. You know you're in the boring lab downstairs, but youÂ don't know the room number.

Ooh, is baby on the move? Whatever it was stopped. Â Ting messages you asking about the MyEclipse setup. You answer his questions and send him a file he needs. He says you'll do the commit of your files when he gets back from his meeting. You're still debating about the JavaScript book. $25 seems like a lot for a technical book that's a couple years old, but this ""course"" seems like it would be very helpful to follow. You decide to download a sample. Ah, the email with the room assignments has arrived! You print out a copy and retrieve it from the printer. You warp yourself in your blanket. Still cold. You start reading the sample of the Javascript book. Oh you should probably change the URL for your adapters. You do that and then go back to the JavaScript book.

255pm
Maryam and Sumayya want to go for another walk, but Manjula wanted to walk at 4:30 and Ting is coming back. You go get water before he comes back. The JavaScript book is making you sleeeepy. Kashif messages you offering cake. How can you turn down strawberry shortcake? It's good. You finish the first two chapters of the book and start on the intro course in Codeacademy. It's a little too basic for you. Um... can you skip this stuff?

Ting is back. You work together on submitting your code. Ting seems impressed by what you did on your own. It wasn't that hard to figure out. Ting will do the config files. You already tried your hand at them, but you missed something, so it's probably faster if he does them anyway. You Q Manjula to ask if she still wants to walk, but she's in a meeting. Everyone always has meetings. One nice thing about ISAAC, besides code reviews, they have very few meetings.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_164635.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4567"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_164635-225x300.jpg"" alt=""20140423_164635"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

4:42pm
Since you're not going on a walk, guess you'll have your snack and play with Javascript some more. Sumayya asks if you're walking. You tell her Manjula has a meeting. Anthony asks you a question. You don't understand, you ask for clarification. You answer his question and... he's gone. Manjula comes in for you to sign Joe's card. She wants to know if you have $100, she'll give you smaller bills. You think you broke your last one, but nope, you have one left. She's very excited. Shes comes back with change. All these singles will not fit in your wallet. She trades you a $20. You chat about the baby and maternity leave. Maryam comes in because she hears you giggling. Sumayya heard you giggling, so she comes too. You go to the bathroom. When you get back, you see your dad is calling. He says he didn't get the notification about the bill, so he sent in the payment and paid $10 extra to expedite it. Bummer.

5:30pm
You text Bryan that you're leaving, but stopping at Target. You see Sumayya leaving on your way out,so you wait for her and leave together. Oh it's definitely too cold out for a walk today, Target it is. You arrive at Target. You wait as an adorable little boy insists on picking out his own shopping basket. You buy shampoo, conditioner, pregnancy related tummy medicines, more containers and jam.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_182435.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4575"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_182435-300x225.jpg"" alt=""20140423_182435"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

You take 35 to the Parkway home, which you wouldn't normally do, but it's later and traffic shouldn't be bad. It's not.

You arrive home undamaged and Bryan hugs you hello. He puts his head on your belly to hear the baby. He hears 'grr-argle-raarg.' ""Oh!"" ""That's my tummy growling. I'm hungry."" He hopes your baby doesn't go deaf from your loud tummy noises :D You heat up some leftovers for dinner. Your avocado isn't quite ripe, you'll eat it tomorrow. Bryan talks about how cute Lyra is hangry. He vacuumed upstairs today. You eat your food and take your vitamins. The Wordpress on your iPad isn't working, so you take out your laptop instead. You ask BryanÂ where you should eat with Helen and Darian. You suggest Seasons52. He's OK with that if it's open now. There's 274 reviews, so you assume it's open. Oh boy, Lyra was moved from the NICU to the nursery :D

Step check: 6660 ... better walk a little more

You go upstairs to hunt for your camera charger. It must be somewhere. That didn't take long, it was in your suitcase as you suspected. You charge your battery, though it'll probably take the rest of the night, so guess you'll keep using your phone for pictures. That's OK, makes it easier to upload. You go back to reading the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0ynr/throwaway_time_whats_your_secret_that_could/"">reddit thread</a> you started a Â few days ago on peoples deepest, darkest secrets. If you ever want to feel really good about your life, this is where to go. A lot of the secrets are sad, but no matter what problems you think youÂ have, they don't come close to these.

You want a little something sweet, but it's too cold for ice cream. You look in the fridge to see what else you have. (I know I say sweets are one of my aversions, but it's more like certain sweets and in larger amounts.) You find some thin mints leftover from the ice cream you made for Easter. You have four of those. Your tummy thinks that's more than enough. Bryan thinks you smell good. He wants to know if he should tell you if one day he thinks you smell bad. ""If you don't have something nice to say..."" ""then say it?"" ""no."" You put away the rest of the cookies and make yourself some chocolate banana overnight oats for tomorrow. Bryan asks you where the hand blender goes, you tell him behind the Crock-pot. He remembers. He comments that you haven't seen Helen and Darian in a long while. You've grown a Â hiccuping human since then.

You go upstairs and pick out your clothes. What to wear? Oh right, it's Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, you have to wear your att shirt. Well that makes life easy. You put your clothes out, change into something more comfy, put up your hair, floss and brush your teeth. You head back downstairs. It's Star Trek time!

8:30pm
You put on DS9. Bryan uses the elliptical while you walk/jump on the mini trampoline. Not the best episode ever, but not awful. Bryan sees a centipede in the laundry room as you're heading out. He tells you to go on while he kills it. He says it was a female, very big and in a bad place.

9:20pm
You head upstairs, take out your contacts and get ready for bed. You read your pregnancy book on your kindle while Bryan showers. He gets out and you have him rub the belly oil on. You cuddle for a little while and then say goodnight andÂ try to drift off to sleep. Oh that was definitely the baby moving, probably, it tickled.

You have a dream about a big mall with a space museum attached and Bill Nye the Science Guy was there. Also a dream that you backed into a space perfectly, accidentally, but it was a reserved spot, but the person said you could park there anyway since your neighbor was in your spot. You wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep, but you must have drifted off at some point because your alarm wakes you at 6:30.",A Day in the Life 2014,,,,,,

5:10am
You had dreams about HS choir, hadn't had one of those in a while, except you're pregnant in the dream. And sidewalk chalk? You think you feel your fitbit buzzing, nope, way too early. You take a sip of water and use your saline spray. You roll back over onto your left side and go back to sleep.

6:05am
Still too early. You try going back to sleep. You fail. You're hungry. You don't know why since you felt uncomfortably stuffed last night. You decide to get up early. You turn off the fan and air filter. You grab your cellphone and your cup of water, put them down on the bathroom sink. You hear Bryan in the kitchen downstairs while you put on your robe and socks. You head downstairs for breakfast, Bryan has disappeared back into the basement. You heat up a glass of water. You eat part of your strawberry-banana overnight oats. You check Facebook, no new Lyra pictures :( You check your email and the pregnancy app to see today's tip while you drink your water.

6:30am
Your fitbit alarm goes off. You go upstairs to the bathroom, put in your contacts, brush your teeth, put on your workout clothes and head back down. Bryan comes up, hugs you, and informs you he was reading about the baby. It has hiccups and can blink. He goes upstairs to sleep. You weigh yourself before going down into the basement, 107.8, and record it in your pregnancy app. Today is the best workout of the week - prenatal yoga. Oh the stretchy goodness.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4561"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800-225x300.jpg"" alt=""20140423_064800"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

After yoga, you grab another bite of your breakfast and then head upstairs to shower. You wash your hair, wash your body, shave, was your face and longer a little too long under the nice, warm water. You need more conditioner. Maybe you'll go to Target after work. You always say that, you never do. Maybe you will today since you have witnesses. You finally step out and dry yourself off. You put lotion and makeup on, comb and towel dry your hair and belly butter-up your body. You practice your next toastmasters speech as you get ready. You get dressed and head downstairs.

8:15am
Wow, you woke up early and you might actually leave early, that never happens. You take your vitamins, grab your breakfast and lunch from the fridge, gather up the rest of your stuff and head out. You wear your wool coat today since it's supposed to be a little chilly. You buckle yourself in with your dream baby Bump Belt.

(This was written after I arrived at work. Never text and drive!) The radio says there was an accident on the Parkway, but it was just North of you, so it should be OK. You've been taking the Parkway because they're doing crazy construction on 35. Hmm, right lane, left lane, you pick the left lane. Whoot, good choice, that also never happens! There's a truck in the right. You speed past everyone stuck behind the truck, muahaha. On the Parkway you slow down to let the crazy person in front of you, hmm, that's not a NJ plate. And now the dudeÂ behind you is tailgating. You go over to the middle lane. The guy behind him is tailgating too, he gets over. They're talking to the guy from ""My Cat From Hell"" on the radio - good show. He's funny. Almost to work. Wow, does this person realize there are two lanes here? Don't bother checking to see if there's someone in the other lane, why would you do that? Oh, is he going to get over again? NY license plate. Yup, yup, look at that, and didn't check the other lane again. I would honk if I were that other car. Â Of course they're turning into at&amp;t.

8:55am
You park in the parking garage and take the elevatorÂ up to your office. You can carry the laptop or the baby up the stairs, but not both. You plug in your laptop and finish your breakfast as you check your email. Nitika comes in, you say good morning. SheÂ jokes, ""did you go home?"" ""Right after you."" You go put your food in the fridge and fill your water bottle. You squeeze in some lemon juice. You're cold. Probably will end up keeping your coat on all day again. You hear bagel day in full swing down the hall. You review I-Hsiung's updated HLD and send your updated estimate to Hsiu-Mei. You hear Maryam shuffle into Nitika's office, you go over to visit too.

4:42pm
Since you're not going on a walk, guess you'll have your snack and play with Javascript some more. Sumayya asks if you're walking. You tell her Manjula has a meeting. Anthony asks you a question. You don't understand, you ask for clarification. You answer his question and... he's gone. Manjula comes in for you to sign Joe's card. She wants to know if you have $100, she'll give you smaller bills. You think you broke your last one, but nope, you have one left. She's very excited. Shes comes back with change. All these singles will not fit in your wallet. She trades you a $20. You chat about the baby and maternity leave. Maryam comes in because she hears you giggling. Sumayya heard you giggling, so she comes too. You go to the bathroom. When you get back, you see your dad is calling. He says he didn't get the notification about the bill, so he sent in the payment and paid $10 extra to expedite it. Bummer.

5:30pm
You text Bryan that you're leaving, but stopping at Target. You see Sumayya leaving on your way out,so you wait for her and leave together. Oh it's definitely too cold out for a walk today, Target it is. You arrive at Target. You wait as an adorable little boy insists on picking out his own shopping basket. You buy shampoo, conditioner, pregnancy related tummy medicines, more containers and jam.

You take 35 to the Parkway home, which you wouldn't normally do, but it's later and traffic shouldn't be bad. It's not.

You arrive home undamaged and Bryan hugs you hello. He puts his head on your belly to hear the baby. He hears 'grr-argle-raarg.' ""Oh!"" ""That's my tummy growling. I'm hungry."" He hopes your baby doesn't go deaf from your loud tummy noises :D You heat up some leftovers for dinner. Your avocado isn't quite ripe, you'll eat it tomorrow. Bryan talks about how cute Lyra is hangry. He vacuumed upstairs today. You eat your food and take your vitamins. The Wordpress on your iPad isn't working, so you take out your laptop instead. You ask BryanÂ where you should eat with Helen and Darian. You suggest Seasons52. He's OK with that if it's open now. There's 274 reviews, so you assume it's open. Oh boy, Lyra was moved from the NICU to the nursery :D

Step check: 6660 ... better walk a little more

You go upstairs to hunt for your camera charger. It must be somewhere. That didn't take long, it was in your suitcase as you suspected. You charge your battery, though it'll probably take the rest of the night, so guess you'll keep using your phone for pictures. That's OK, makes it easier to upload. You go back to reading the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0ynr/throwaway_time_whats_your_secret_that_could/"">reddit thread</a> you started a Â few days ago on peoples deepest, darkest secrets. If you ever want to feel really good about your life, this is where to go. A lot of the secrets are sad, but no matter what problems I think I have, they don't come close to these.

You want a little something sweet, but it's too cold for ice cream. You look in the fridge to see what else you have. (I know I say sweets are one of my aversions, but it's more like certain sweets and in larger amounts.) You find some thin mints leftover from the ice cream you made for Easter. You have four of those. Your tummy thinks that'sÂ enough. Bryan thinks you smell good. He wants to know if he should tell you if one day he thinks you smell bad. ""If you don't have something nice to say..."" ""then say it?"" ""no."" You put away the rest of the cookies and make yourself some chocolate banana overnight oats for tomorrow. Bryan asks you where the hand blender goes, you tell him behind the Crock-pot. He remembers. He comments that you haven't seen Helen and Darian in a long while. You've grown a whole hiccuping human since then.

You go upstairs and pick out your clothes. What to wear? Oh right, it's Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, you have to wear your att shirt. Well that makes life easy. You put your clothes out, change into something more comfy, put up your hair, floss and brush your teeth. You head back downstairs. It's Star Trek time!

8:30pm
You put on DS9. Bryan uses the elliptical while you jump on the mini trampoline. Not the best episode ever, but not awful. Bryan sees a centipede in the laundry room as you're heading out. He tells you to go on while he kills it. He says it was very big and in a bad place. He says it was female.

9:20pm
You head upstairs, take out your contacts and get ready for bed. You read your pregnancy book on your kindle while Bryan showers. He gets out and you have him rub the belly oil on. You cuddle for a little while and then say goodnight andÂ try to drift off to sleep. Oh that was definitely the baby moving, probably, it tickled.

You have a dream about a big mall with a space museum attached and Bill Nye the Science Guy was there. Also a dream that you backed into a space perfectly, accidentally, but it was a reserved spot, but the person said you could park there anyway since your neighbor was in your spot. You wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep, but you must have drifted off at some point because your alarm wakes you at 6:30.",A Day in the Life 2014,,,,,,

My eating behaviors are socially acceptable. People expect me to be hungry and stuffing my face all the time now. In fact, I'll often get food shoved in my face. It's a little awesome. This hasn't happened yet, but if someone makes something awful, I have an excellent excuse not to eat it: oh, sorry, not loving that right now, must be a pregnancy thing.

Also, I'm not peeing that much more than usual, more like, it's just more urgent than usual, but people expect me to have to pee a lot now, so I can totally get up in the middle of a meeting to go to the bathroom and not feel weird about it.

I have an excuse to randomly nap during the day. Also, to veg out after work and not do any chores. Didn't get my 10,000 steps in today? It's OK, I'm taking it easy today. Don't want to take the stairs? That's cool too.

Walk into a meeting and all the chairs are taken, two people offer up their seats and I don't have to feel guilty about taking one.

Conversations with acquaintances are less awkward. People have something to talk to me about.

My hair looks really good. My skin too. This is the longest I've gone without a breakout since being on antibiotics before our wedding.

I don't freak outÂ when my pants don't fit.

Shopping for baby clothes. Haven't bought any yet besides the Disney onesie, but it's fun to look.

Baby moving - definitely the most fun part. I can sit and watch him bump around in there for the longest time. It's very relaxing.  

In other news - I had a happy birthday filled with a lot of food, friends and family :) My coworkers treated me to lunch at this great pizza place and we had a party yesterday at our house. I made these oreo ice cream cheesecake balls that I didn't put out because they were too yummy and I want them all to myself. 

Saturday, Bryan's family had a little reunion at Nana's and there was a giant bar of chocolate.

5:10am
You had dreams about HS choir, hadn't had one of those in a while, except you're pregnant in the dream. And sidewalk chalk? You think you feel your fitbit buzzing, nope, way too early. You take a sip of water and use your saline spray. You roll back over onto your left side and go back to sleep.

6:05am
Still too early. You try going back to sleep. You fail. You're hungry. You don't know why since you felt uncomfortably stuffed last night. You decide to get up early. You turn off the fan and air filter. You grab your cellphone and your cup of water, put them down on the bathroom sink. You hear Bryan in the kitchen downstairs while you put on your robe and socks. You head downstairs for breakfast, Bryan has disappeared back into the basement. You heat up a glass of water. You eat part of your strawberry-banana overnight oats. You check Facebook, no new Lyra pictures :(, your email and the pregnancy app to see today's tip while you drink your water.

6:30am
Your fitbit alarm goes off. You go upstairs to the bathroom, put in your contacts, brush your teeth, put on your workout clothes and head back down. Bryan comes up and hugs you as you and informs you he was reading about the baby. It has hiccups and can blink. You weigh yourself before going down into the basement, 107.8, and record it in your pregnancy app. Today is the best workout of the week - prenatal yoga. Oh the stretchy goodness. 

After yoga, you head upstairs to shower. You wash your hair, wash your body, shave, was your face and longer a little too long under the nice, warm water. You finally step out and dry yourself off. You put lotion and makeup on, comb and towel dry your hair and belly butter-up your body. You practice your next toastmasters speech as you get ready. You get dressed and head downstairs.

8:15am
Wow, you woke up early and you might actually leave early, that never happens. You take your vitamins, grab your breakfast and lunch from the fridge, gather up the rest of your stuff and head out. You buckle yourself in with your dream baby Bump Belt. Your not sure it does much, of course you don't have much of a bump yet.",A Day in the Life 2014,,,,,,

After yoga, you grab another bite of your breakfast and then head upstairs to shower. You wash your hair, wash your body, shave, wash your face and longer a little too long under the nice, warm water. You need more conditioner. Maybe you'll go to Target after work. You always say that, you never do. Maybe you will today since you have witnesses. You finally step out and dry yourself off. You put lotion and makeup on, comb and towel dry your hair and belly butter-up. You practice your next toastmasters speech as you get ready. You get dressed and head downstairs.

(This was written after I arrived at work. Never text and drive!) The radio says there was an accident on the Parkway, but it was just North of you, so it should be OK. You've been taking the Parkway because they're doing crazy construction on 35. Hmm, right lane, left lane? You pick the left lane. Whoot, good choice, that also never happens! There's a truck in the right. You speed past everyone stuck behind the truck, muahaha. On the Parkway you slow down to let the crazy person go in front of you. And now the dudeÂ behind you is tailgating. You go over to the middle lane. They're talking to the guy from ""My Cat From Hell"" on the radio - good show. He's funny. Almost to work. Wow, does this person realize there are two lanes here? Don't bother checking to see if there's someone in the other lane, why would you do that? Oh, is he going to get over again? Yup, yup, look at that, and didn't check the other lane again. I would honk if I were that other car. Â Of course they're turning into at&amp;t.

8:55am
You park in the parking garage and take the elevatorÂ up to your office. You can carry the laptop or the baby up the stairs, but not both. You plug in your laptop and finish your breakfast as you check your email. Nitika comes in, you say good morning. SheÂ jokes, ""did you go home?"" ""Right after you."" You go put your food in the fridge and fill your water bottle. You squeeze in some lemon juice. You're cold. Probably will end up keeping your coat on all day again. You hear bagel day in full swing down the hall. You review I-Hsiung's updated HLD and send your updated estimate to Hsiu-Mei. You hear Maryam shuffle into Nitika's office, you go over to visit too. NitikaÂ asks how ""mommy's doing."" You're cold.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4563"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1528b"" width=""540"" height=""405"" /></a>

Potty break. On the way, you stop by Maryam's office because Bushra is there and Sumayya and Merzia come over too. You grab Nitika. Maryam is teasing one of them about being next to get pregnant. You happen to know she's already pregnant and she finally announces it! You won't say who since she wants to keep it just between yourÂ group for now. Anthony and Mark come over because they hear your giggling. YouÂ all chat for a while. Anthony thinks you're having a boy, Nitika thinks it's a girl.Â The party breaks up and you complete your journey to the bathroom.

Rocky emails you the workforce management graphic to upload to their tSpace community. It doesn't want to upload. You save it as a different file format, that works for some reason. Ting wants to submit the code into the repository today, so you check to make sure you've named your files correctly as you've changed them like three times already because, um, pregnancy makes you dyslexic? You realize you never approved Rich's document because Prism was down, oops. You go do that now.

11am
You're hungry. Lunch time! You go heat up your food. Someone left a paper towel in the sink? There's no reason for that. You check Facebook. You have a message from Greg (yup, same Candadian Greg) left from yourÂ conversation last night. You had no idea he had a baby. You hadn't talked in a while. You also have a message from Helen working out dinner plans in a couple weeks. The microwave dings. Yumm, Bryan's chili. This should warm you up. You make your ""walk?"" times poll while you eat. You have no meeting today besides this optional brown bag on the new mobile share plans, should be easy to schedule for you. Oh, right, that's jalapeno, not green pepper, hot, hot, very hot. Well, that'll clear out your sinuses. Only one tissue left :(

Kushal comes by with a chocolate egg for you that he got from Phyllis. He had too many already. Yip, dessert. People are not voting in your poll. Manjula says she can only go at 2:30. Nitika wants to know if your internet is slow. Not that you've noticed. People voted. You message the group informing them of walks at 12:30 and 4:30 today. There's an after work get together at Bonefish today that you won't be going to. Not as much fun when you can't drink.

Julia wants to know if you're going to have a reveal cake with pink or blue inside. You say yes, an ice cream cake, but you need help with the cake part. Anthony mentioned earlierÂ he's learning JavaScript, so you message and ask how since it's something you need to pick up as well. He sends you a <a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/#How_NOT_To_Learn_JavaScript"">url</a>. The workforce management people are very happy with their tSpace - huzzah! OK, now your internet is slow. Since you can't do much, you decide to join the first half of the brown bag. You check your wireless account and it says it hasn't been paid yet. You call your dad to make sure switching plans didn't mess up any autopay he had setup. Anthony asks what else is on your list to learn. You're mostly focusing on mobile development stuff since you have to learn one of the strategic areas by EOY. Hmm, should you buy the kindle book or wait for the paperback in the mail. Kindle book you can start with now. It's expensive :(

12:30pm
You grab the girls for your walk, but Nitika's on the phone and Merzia is still eating, so you wait a bit. The four of you walk down. Coming back from your first round, you run into Maryam who has a little time before her next meeting. At the end of the walk, you stop by the vendors. Maryam has to go back upstairs. There's a very good lamp salesman who talks the four of you into buying almost $200 worth of lamps. You get <a href=""http://www.lampofaroma.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PI-060"">yours </a>for the cheapest since you didn't really want one. Peer pressure. Yiding walks by as you're browsing and you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the counts for October and probably we won't have to modify them at all for the clfi change.

You take the elevator back up to your offices. Your mom called when you were on your walk, so you call back. She was looking at diapers and strollers and will send you links. You tell her you're coming home this weekend. You check and see if you have an email about your room assignment for Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, but you don't see one. You know you're in the boring lab downstairs, but youÂ don't know the room number.

Ooh, is baby on the move? Whatever it was stopped. Â Ting messages you asking about the MyEclipse setup. You answer his questions and send him a file he needs. He says you'll do the commit of your files when he gets back from his meeting. You're still debating about the JavaScript book. $25 seems like a lot for a technical book that's a couple years old, but this ""course"" seems like it would be very helpful to follow. You decide to download a sample. Ah, the email with the room assignments has arrived! You print out a copy and retrieve it from the printer. You warp yourself in your blanket. Still cold. You start reading the sample of the Javascript book. Oh you should probably change the URL for your adapters. You do that and then go back to the JavaScript book.

255pm
Maryam and Sumayya want to go for another walk, but Manjula wanted to walk at 4:30 and Ting is coming back. You go get water before he comes back. The JavaScript book is making you sleeeepy. Kashif messages you offering cake. How can you turn down strawberry shortcake? It's good. You finish the first two chapters of the book and start on the intro course in Codeacademy. It's a little too basic for you. Um... can you skip this stuff?

Ting is back. You work together on submitting your code. Ting seems impressed by what you did on your own. It wasn't that hard to figure out. Ting will do the config files. You already tried your hand at them, but you missed something, so it's probably faster if he does them anyway. You Q Manjula to ask if she still wants to walk, but she's in a meeting. Everyone always has meetings. One nice thing about ISAAC, besides code reviews, they have very few meetings.

4:42pm
Since you're not going on a walk, guess you'll have your snack and play with Javascript some more. Sumayya asks if you're walking. You tell her Manjula has a meeting. Anthony asks you a question. You don't understand, you ask for clarification. You answer his question and... he's gone. Manjula comes in for you to sign Joe's card. She wants to know if you have $100, she'll give you smaller bills. You think you broke your last one, but nope, you have one left. She's very excited. Shes comes back with change. All these singles will not fit in your wallet. She trades you a $20. You chat about the baby and maternity leave. Maryam comes in because she hears you giggling. Sumayya heard you giggling, so she comes too. You go to the bathroom. When you get back, you see your dad is calling. He says he didn't get the notification about the bill, so he sent in the payment and paid $10 extra to expedite it. Bummer.

5:30pm
You text Bryan that you're leaving, but stopping at Target. You see Sumayya leaving on your way out,so you wait for her and leave together. Oh it's definitely too cold out for a walk today, Target it is. You arrive at Target. You wait as an adorable little boy insists on picking out his own shopping basket. You buy shampoo, conditioner, pregnancy related tummy medicines, more containers and jam.

You take 35 to the Parkway home, which you wouldn't normally do, but it's later and traffic shouldn't be bad. It's not.

You arrive home undamaged and Bryan hugs you hello. He puts his head on your belly to hear the baby. He hears 'grr-argle-raarg.' ""Oh!"" ""That's my tummy growling. I'm hungry."" He hopes your baby doesn't go deaf from your loud tummy noises :D You heat up some leftovers for dinner. Your avocado isn't quite ripe, you'll eat it tomorrow. Bryan talks about how cute Lyra is hangry. He vacuumed upstairs today. You eat your food and take your vitamins. The Wordpress on your iPad isn't working, so you take out your laptop instead. You ask BryanÂ where you should eat with Helen and Darian. You suggest Seasons52. He's OK with that if it's open now. There's 274 reviews, so you assume it's open. Oh boy, Lyra was moved from the NICU to the nursery :D

You go upstairs to hunt for your camera charger. It must be somewhere. That didn't take long, it was in your suitcase as you suspected.

You want a little something sweet, but it's too cold for ice cream. You look in the fridge to see what else you have. (I know I say sweets are one of my aversions, but it's more like certain sweets and in larger amounts.) You find some thin mints leftover from the ice cream you made for Easter. You have four of those. Your tummy thinks that's more than enough. Bryan thinks you smell good. He wants to know if he should tell you if one day he thinks you smell bad. ""If you don't have something nice to say..."" ""then say it?"" ""no."" You put away the rest of the cookies and make yourself some chocolate banana overnight oats for tomorrow. Bryan asks you where the hand blender goes, you tell him behind the Crock-pot. He remembers. He comments that you haven't seen Helen and Darian in a long while. You've grown a Â hiccuping human since then.

You go upstairs and pick out your clothes. What to wear? Oh right, it's Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, you have to wear your att shirt. Well that makes life easy. You put your clothes out, change into something more comfy, put up your hair, floss and brush your teeth. You head back downstairs. It's Star Trek time!

You put on DS9. Bryan uses the elliptical while you walk/jump on the mini trampoline. Not the best episode ever, but not awful. Bryan sees a centipede in the laundry room as you're heading out. He tells you to go on while he kills it. He says it was a female, very big and in a bad place.

5:10am
You had dreams about HS choir, hadn't had one of those in a while. And sidewalk chalk? You think you feel your fitbit buzzing, nope, way too early. You take a sip of water and use your saline nasal spray. You roll back over onto your left side and go back to sleep.

6:05am
Still too early. You try going back to sleep. You fail. You're hungry. You don't know why since you felt uncomfortably stuffed last night. You decide to get up early. You turn off the fan and air filter. You grab your cellphone and your cup of water, put them down on the bathroom sink. You hear Bryan in the kitchen downstairs while you put on your robe and socks. You head downstairs for breakfast, Bryan has disappeared back into the basement. You heat up a glass of water. You eat part of your strawberry-banana overnight oats. You check Facebook, no new Lyra pictures yet :( You check your email and the pregnancy app to see today's tip while you drink your water.

6:30am
Your fitbit alarm goes off. You go upstairs to the bathroom, put in your contacts, brush your teeth, put on your workout clothes and head back down. Bryan comes up, hugs you, and informs you he was reading about the baby. It has hiccups and can blink. He goes upstairs to sleep. You weigh yourself before going down into the basement, 107.8, and record it in your pregnancy app. Today is the best workout of the week - prenatal yoga. Oh the stretchy goodness.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4561"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_064800-225x300.jpg"" alt=""20140423_064800"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>

After yoga, you grab another bite of your breakfast and then head upstairs to shower. You wash your hair, wash your body, shave, wash your face and longer a little too long under the nice, warm water. You need more conditioner. Maybe you'll go to Target after work. You always say that, you never do. Maybe you will today since you have witnesses. You finally step out and dry yourself off. You put lotion and makeup on, comb and towel dry your hair and belly butter-up. You practice your next toastmasters speech as you get ready. You get dressed and head downstairs.

8:15am
Wow, you woke up early and you might actually leave early, that never happens. You take your vitamins, grab your breakfast and lunch from the fridge, gather up the rest of your stuff and head out. You wear your wool coat today since it's supposed to be a little chilly. You buckle yourself in with your Dream Baby Bump Belt.

(This was written after I arrived at work. Never text and drive!) The radio says there was an accident on the Parkway, but it was just North of you, so it should be OK. You've been taking the Parkway because they're doing crazy construction on 35. Hmm, right lane, left lane? You pick the left lane. Whoot, good choice, that also never happens! There's a truck in the right. You speed past everyone stuck behind the truck, muahaha. On the Parkway you slow down to let the crazy person go in front of you. And now the dudeÂ behind you is tailgating. You go over to the middle lane. They're talking to the guy from ""My Cat From Hell"" on the radio - good show. He's funny. Almost to work. Wow, does this person realize there are two lanes here? Don't bother checking to see if there's someone in the other lane, why would you do that? Oh, is he going to get over again? Yup, yup, look at that, and didn't check the other lane again. I would honk if I were that other car. Â Of course they're turning into at&amp;t.

8:55am
You park in the parking garage and take the elevatorÂ up to your office. You can carry the laptop or the baby up the stairs, but not both. You plug in your laptop and finish your breakfast as you check your email. Nitika comes in, you say good morning. SheÂ jokes, ""did you go home?"" ""Right after you."" You go put your food in the fridge and fill your water bottle. You squeeze in some lemon juice. You're cold. Probably will end up keeping your coat on all day again. You hear bagel day in full swing down the hall. You review I-Hsiung's updated HLD and send your updated estimate to Hsiu-Mei. You hear Maryam shuffle into Nitika's office, you go over to visit too. NitikaÂ asks how ""mommy's doing."" You're cold.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4563"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1528b"" width=""540"" height=""405"" /></a>

Potty break. On the way, you stop by Maryam's office because Bushra is there and Sumayya and Merzia come over too. You grab Nitika. Maryam is teasing one of them about being next to get pregnant. You happen to know she's already pregnant and she finally announces it! You won't say who since she wants to keep it just between yourÂ group for now. Anthony and Mark come over because they hear your giggling. YouÂ all chat for a while. Anthony thinks you're having a boy, Nitika thinks it's a girl.Â The party breaks up and you complete your journey to the bathroom.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1531.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4564"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1531-300x225.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1531"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

Rocky emails you the workforce management graphic to upload to their tSpace community. It doesn't want to upload. You save it as a different file format, that works for some reason. Ting wants to submit the code into the repository today, so you check to make sure you've named your files correctly as you've changed them like three times already because, um, pregnancy makes you dyslexic? You realize you never approved Rich's document because Prism was down, oops. You go do that now.

11am
You're hungry. Lunch time! You go heat up your food. Someone left a paper towel in the sink? There's no reason for that. You check Facebook. You have a message from Greg (yup, same Candadian Greg) left from yourÂ conversation last night. You had no idea he had a baby. You hadn't talked in a while. You also have a message from Helen working out dinner plans in a couple weeks. The microwave dings. Yumm, Bryan's chili. This should warm you up. You make your ""walk?"" times poll while you eat. You have no meeting today besides this optional brown bag on the new mobile share plans, should be easy to schedule for you. Oh, right, that's jalapeno, not green pepper, hot, hot, very hot. Well, that'll clear out your sinuses. Only one tissue left :(

Kushal comes by with a chocolate egg for you that he got from Phyllis. He had too many already. Yip, dessert. People are not voting in your poll. Manjula says she can only go at 2:30. Nitika wants to know if your internet is slow. Not that you've noticed. People voted. You message the group informing them of walks at 12:30 and 4:30 today. There's an after work get together at Bonefish today that you won't be going to. Not as much fun when you can't drink.

Julia wants to know if you're going to have a reveal cake with pink or blue inside. You say yes, an ice cream cake, but you need help with the cake part. Anthony mentioned earlierÂ he's learning JavaScript, so you message and ask how since it's something you need to pick up as well. He sends you a <a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/#How_NOT_To_Learn_JavaScript"">url</a>. The workforce management people are very happy with their tSpace - huzzah! OK, now your internet is slow. Since you can't do much, you decide to join the first half of the brown bag. You check your wireless account and it says it hasn't been paid yet. You call your dad to make sure switching plans didn't mess up any autopay he had setup. Anthony asks what else is on your list to learn. You're mostly focusing on mobile development stuff since you have to learn one of the strategic areas by EOY. Hmm, should you buy the kindle book or wait for the paperback in the mail. Kindle book you can start with now. It's expensive :(

12:30pm
You grab the girls for your walk, but Nitika's on the phone and Merzia is still eating, so you wait a bit. The four of you walk down. Coming back from your first round, you run into Maryam who has a little time before her next meeting. At the end of the walk, you stop by the vendors. Maryam has to go back upstairs. There's a very good lamp salesman who talks the four of you into buying almost $200 worth of lamps. You get <a href=""http://www.lampofaroma.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PI-060"">yours </a>for the cheapest since you didn't really want one. Peer pressure. Yiding walks by as you're browsing and you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the counts for October and probably we won't have to modify them at all for the clfi change.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_130901.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4566"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_130901-300x225.jpg"" alt=""20140423_130901"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

You take the elevator back up to your offices. Your mom called when you were on your walk, so you call back. She was looking at diapers and strollers and will send you links. You tell her you're coming home this weekend. You check and see if you have an email about your room assignment for Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, but you don't see one. You know you're in the boring lab downstairs, but youÂ don't know the room number.

Ooh, is baby on the move? Whatever it was stopped. Â Ting messages you asking about the MyEclipse setup. You answer his questions and send him a file he needs. He says you'll do the commit of your files when he gets back from his meeting. You're still debating about the JavaScript book. $25 seems like a lot for a technical book that's a couple years old, but this ""course"" seems like it would be very helpful to follow. You decide to download a sample. Ah, the email with the room assignments has arrived! You print out a copy and retrieve it from the printer. You warp yourself in your blanket. Still cold. You start reading the sample of the Javascript book. Oh you should probably change the URL for your adapters. You do that and then go back to the JavaScript book.

255pm
Maryam and Sumayya want to go for another walk, but Manjula wanted to walk at 4:30 and Ting is coming back. You go get water before he comes back. The JavaScript book is making you sleeeepy. Kashif messages you offering cake. How can you turn down strawberry shortcake? It's good. You finish the first two chapters of the book and start on the intro course in Codeacademy. It's a little too basic for you. Um... can you skip this stuff?

Ting is back. You work together on submitting your code. Ting seems impressed by what you did on your own. It wasn't that hard to figure out. Ting will do the config files. You already tried your hand at them, but you missed something, so it's probably faster if he does them anyway. You Q Manjula to ask if she still wants to walk, but she's in a meeting. Everyone always has meetings. One nice thing about ISAAC, besides code reviews, they have very few meetings.

4:42pm
Since you're not going on a walk, guess you'll have your snack and play with Javascript some more. Sumayya asks if you're walking. You tell her Manjula has a meeting. Anthony asks you a question. You don't understand, you ask for clarification. You answer his question and... he's gone. Manjula comes in for you to sign Joe's card. She wants to know if you have $100, she'll give you smaller bills. You think you broke your last one, but nope, you have one left. She's very excited. Shes comes back with change. All these singles will not fit in your wallet. She trades you a $20. You chat about the baby and maternity leave. Maryam comes in because she hears you giggling. Sumayya heard you giggling, so she comes too. You go to the bathroom. When you get back, you see your dad is calling. He says he didn't get the notification about the bill, so he sent in the payment and paid $10 extra to expedite it. Bummer.

5:30pm
You text Bryan that you're leaving, but stopping at Target. You see Sumayya leaving on your way out,so you wait for her and leave together. Oh it's definitely too cold out for a walk today, Target it is. You arrive at Target. You wait as an adorable little boy insists on picking out his own shopping basket. You buy shampoo, conditioner, pregnancy related tummy medicines, more containers and jam.

You've been taking the Parkway because they're doing crazy construction on 35. Hmm, right lane, left lane? You pick the left lane. Whoot, good choice, that also never happens! There's a truck in the right. You speed past everyone stuck behind the truck, muahaha. On the Parkway you slow down to let the crazy person go in front of you. And now the dudeÂ behind you is tailgating. You go over to the middle lane. They're talking to the guy from ""My Cat From Hell"" on the radio - good show. He's funny. Almost to work. Wow, does this person realize there are two lanes here? Don't bother checking to see if there's someone in the other lane, why would you do that? Oh, is he going to get over again? Yup, yup, look at that, and didn't check the other lane again. I would honk if I were that other car. Â Of course they're turning into at&amp;t.

8:55am
You park in the parking garage and take the elevatorÂ up to your office. You can carry the laptop or the baby up the stairs, but not both. You plug in your laptop and finish your breakfast as you check your email. Nitika comes in, you say good morning. SheÂ jokes, ""did you go home?"" ""Right after you."" You go put your food in the fridge and fill your water bottle. You squeeze in some lemon juice. You're cold. Probably will end up keeping your coat on all day again. You hear bagel day in full swing down the hall. You review I-Hsiung's updated HLD and send your updated estimate to Hsiu-Mei. You hear Maryam shuffle into Nitika's office, you go over to visit too. NitikaÂ asks how ""mommy's doing."" You're cold.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4563"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1528b-1024x768.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1528b"" width=""540"" height=""405"" /></a>

Potty break. On the way, you stop by Maryam's office because Bushra is there and Sumayya and Merzia come over too. You grab Nitika. Maryam is teasing one of them about being next to get pregnant. You happen to know she's already pregnant and she finally announces it! You won't say who since she wants to keep it just between yourÂ group for now. Anthony and Mark come over because they hear your giggling. YouÂ all chat for a while. Anthony thinks you're having a boy, Nitika thinks it's a girl.Â The party breaks up and you complete your journey to the bathroom.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1531.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4564"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/IMG_1531-300x225.jpg"" alt=""IMG_1531"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

Rocky emails you the workforce management graphic to upload to their tSpace community. It doesn't want to upload. You save it as a different file format, that works for some reason. Ting wants to submit the code into the repository today, so you check to make sure you've named your files correctly as you've changed them like three times already because, um, pregnancy makes you dyslexic? You realize you never approved Rich's document because Prism was down, oops. You go do that now.

11am
You're hungry. Lunch time! You go heat up your food. Someone left a paper towel in the sink? There's no reason for that. You check Facebook. You have a message from Greg (yup, same Candadian Greg) left from yourÂ conversation last night. You had no idea he had a baby. You hadn't talked in a while. You also have a message from Helen working out dinner plans in a couple weeks. The microwave dings. Yumm, Bryan's chili. This should warm you up. You make your ""walk?"" times poll while you eat. You have no meeting today besides this optional brown bag on the new mobile share plans, should be easy to schedule for you. Oh, right, that's jalapeno, not green pepper, hot, hot, very hot. Well, that'll clear out your sinuses. Only one tissue left :(

Kushal comes by with a chocolate egg for you that he got from Phyllis. He had too many already. Yip, dessert. People are not voting in your poll. Manjula says she can only go at 2:30. Nitika wants to know if your internet is slow. Not that you've noticed. People voted. You message the group informing them of walks at 12:30 and 4:30 today. There's an after work get together at Bonefish today that you won't be going to. Not as much fun when you can't drink.

Julia wants to know if you're going to have a reveal cake with pink or blue inside. You say yes, an ice cream cake, but you need help with the cake part. Anthony mentioned earlierÂ he's learning JavaScript, so you message and ask how since it's something you need to pick up as well. He sends you a <a href=""http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/#How_NOT_To_Learn_JavaScript"">url</a>. The workforce management people are very happy with their tSpace - huzzah! OK, now your internet is slow. Since you can't do much, you decide to join the first half of the brown bag. You check your wireless account and it says it hasn't been paid yet. You call your dad to make sure switching plans didn't mess up any autopay he had setup. Anthony asks what else is on your list to learn. You're mostly focusing on mobile development stuff since you have to learn one of the strategic areas by EOY. Hmm, should you buy the kindle book or wait for the paperback in the mail. Kindle book you can start with now. It's expensive :(

12:30pm
You grab the girls for your walk, but Nitika's on the phone and Merzia is still eating, so you wait a bit. The four of you walk down. Coming back from your first round, you run into Maryam who has a little time before her next meeting. At the end of the walk, you stop by the vendors. Maryam has to go back upstairs. There's a very good lamp salesman who talks the four of you into buying almost $200 worth of lamps. You get <a href=""http://www.lampofaroma.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=PI-060"">yours </a>for the cheapest since you didn't really want one. Peer pressure. Yiding walks by as you're browsing and you tell him he doesn't have to worry about the counts for October and probably we won't have to modify them at all for the clfi change.

You take the elevator back up to your offices. Your mom called when you were on your walk, so you call back. She was looking at diapers and strollers and will send you links. You tell her you're coming home this weekend. You check and see if you have an email about your room assignment for Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, but you don't see one. You know you're in the boring lab downstairs, but youÂ don't know the room number.

Ooh, is baby on the move? Whatever it was stopped. Â Ting messages you asking about the MyEclipse setup. You answer his questions and send him a file he needs. He says you'll do the commit of your files when he gets back from his meeting. You're still debating about the JavaScript book. $25 seems like a lot for a technical book that's a couple years old, but this ""course"" seems like it would be very helpful to follow. You decide to download a sample. Ah, the email with the room assignments has arrived! You print out a copy and retrieve it from the printer. You warp yourself in your blanket. Still cold. You start reading the sample of the Javascript book. Oh you should probably change the URL for your adapters. You do that and then go back to the JavaScript book.

255pm
Maryam and Sumayya want to go for another walk, but Manjula wanted to walk at 4:30 and Ting is coming back. You go get water before he comes back. The JavaScript book is making you sleeeepy. Kashif messages you offering cake. How can you turn down strawberry shortcake? It's good. You finish the first two chapters of the book and start on the intro course in Codeacademy. It's a little too basic for you. Um... can you skip this stuff?

Ting is back. You work together on submitting your code. Ting seems impressed by what you did on your own. It wasn't that hard to figure out. Ting will do the config files. You already tried your hand at them, but you missed something, so it's probably faster if he does them anyway. You Q Manjula to ask if she still wants to walk, but she's in a meeting. Everyone always has meetings. One nice thing about ISAAC, besides code reviews, they have very few meetings.

4:42pm
Since you're not going on a walk, guess you'll have your snack and play with Javascript some more. Sumayya asks if you're walking. You tell her Manjula has a meeting. Anthony asks you a question. You don't understand, you ask for clarification. You answer his question and... he's gone. Manjula comes in for you to sign Joe's card. She wants to know if you have $100, she'll give you smaller bills. You think you broke your last one, but nope, you have one left. She's very excited. Shes comes back with change. All these singles will not fit in your wallet. She trades you a $20. You chat about the baby and maternity leave. Maryam comes in because she hears you giggling. Sumayya heard you giggling, so she comes too. You go to the bathroom. When you get back, you see your dad is calling. He says he didn't get the notification about the bill, so he sent in the payment and paid $10 extra to expedite it. Bummer.

5:30pm
You text Bryan that you're leaving, but stopping at Target. You see Sumayya leaving on your way out,so you wait for her and leave together. Oh it's definitely too cold out for a walk today, Target it is. You arrive at Target. You wait as an adorable little boy insists on picking out his own shopping basket. You buy shampoo, conditioner, pregnancy related tummy medicines, more containers and jam.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_182435.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4575"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/20140423_182435-300x225.jpg"" alt=""20140423_182435"" width=""300"" height=""225"" /></a>

You take 35 to the Parkway home, which you wouldn't normally do, but it's later and traffic shouldn't be bad. It's not.

You arrive home undamaged and Bryan hugs you hello. He puts his head on your belly to hear the baby. He hears 'grr-argle-raarg.' ""Oh!"" ""That's my tummy growling. I'm hungry."" He hopes your baby doesn't go deaf from your loud tummy noises :D You heat up some leftovers for dinner. Your avocado isn't quite ripe, you'll eat it tomorrow. Bryan talks about how cute Lyra is hangry. He vacuumed upstairs today. You eat your food and take your vitamins. The Wordpress on your iPad isn't working, so you take out your laptop instead. You ask BryanÂ where you should eat with Helen and Darian. You suggest Seasons52. He's OK with that if it's open now. There's 274 reviews, so you assume it's open. Oh boy, Lyra was moved from the NICU to the nursery :D

Step check: 6660 ... better walk a little more

You go upstairs to hunt for your camera charger. It must be somewhere. That didn't take long, it was in your suitcase as you suspected. You charge your battery, though it'll probably take the rest of the night, so guess you'll keep using your phone for pictures. That's OK, makes it easier to upload. You go back to reading the <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/t0ynr/throwaway_time_whats_your_secret_that_could/"">reddit thread</a> you started a Â few days ago on peoples deepest, darkest secrets. If you ever want to feel really good about your life, this is where to go. A lot of the secrets are sad, but no matter what problems you think youÂ have, they don't come close to these.

You want a little something sweet, but it's too cold for ice cream. You look in the fridge to see what else you have. (I know I say sweets are one of my aversions, but it's more like certain sweets and in larger amounts.) You find some thin mints leftover from the ice cream you made for Easter. You have four of those. Your tummy thinks that's more than enough. Bryan thinks you smell good. He wants to know if he should tell you if one day he thinks you smell bad. ""If you don't have something nice to say..."" ""then say it?"" ""no."" You put away the rest of the cookies and make yourself some chocolate banana overnight oats for tomorrow. Bryan asks you where the hand blender goes, you tell him behind the Crock-pot. He remembers. He comments that you haven't seen Helen and Darian in a long while. You've grown a Â hiccuping human since then.

You go upstairs and pick out your clothes. What to wear? Oh right, it's Take Your Kids to Work Day tomorrow, you have to wear your att shirt. Well that makes life easy. You put your clothes out, change into something more comfy, put up your hair, floss and brush your teeth. You head back downstairs. It's Star Trek time!

8:30pm
You put on DS9. Bryan uses the elliptical while you walk/jump on the mini trampoline. Not the best episode ever, but not awful. Bryan sees a centipede in the laundry room as you're heading out. He tells you to go on while he kills it. He says it was a female, very big and in a bad place.

Step check: 10049

9:20pm
You head upstairs, take out your contacts and get ready for bed. You read your pregnancy book on your kindle while Bryan showers. He gets out and you have him rub the belly oil on. You cuddle for a little while and then say goodnight andÂ try to drift off to sleep. Oh that was definitely the baby moving, probably, it tickled.

You have a dream about a big mall with a space museum attached and Bill Nye the Science Guy was there. Also a dream that you backed into a space perfectly, accidentally, but it was a reserved spot, but the person said you could park there anyway since your neighbor was in your spot. You wake up in the middle of the night and have trouble falling back asleep, but you must have drifted off at some point because your alarm wakes you at 6:30.",A Day in the Life 2014,,,,,,

Twenty week picture + a pic of Noel, my parents' dog they adopted last week from the shelter. She's hilarious.
Work has been fun. Studying, studying. Javascript and related technologies. Getting ready for my next project.

And thought I'd share my most recent Toastmasters speech: 
<!--more-->

Thinking for Two

This speech wasnât going to be about pregnancy, but I found it too difficult to focus on anything else. Every decision I make, every movement, every thought I have, my growing belly is at the back of my mind. This baby isnât even born yet and it has already taken over my my life.
Have you heard the term, âbaby brain?â This refers to the absent mindedness that many women suffer from when theyâre pregnant. Scientists and health care professionals will tell you itâs not a real thing; thereâs no scientific reason that a womanâs mental capacity would be diminished during pregnancy, but I think itâs very real. How could it not be? How can I be at 100% mental capacity when the baby is taking up at least 10% at all times?

This was especially bad in the first trimester. I couldn't even do basic math. And I couldn't go to toastmaster meetings, not because I was busy, but because I was so tired and so nauseous. I napped instead. On days when the nap didn't happen, I'd wind up wandering around the house crying: why won't this peanut butter jar open!

Now in the second trimester, things have gotten a little better. my thoughts have moved to - I am so hungry. I have to peeâ¦ again. Do I look pregnant yet? What can I wear that still fits... Was that the baby moving? â¦ Was that the baby moving?
Itâs not just me thinking about baby. Every conversation I have starts the same way: âHow are you feeling? Howâs the baby?â. Good, um, you know, itâs still in there. Do I know the gender? No, not yet. And if the conversation goes on long enough, it will inevitably turn to my bowel movements. â...Are you constipated?â No, thanks for asking.  Iâm just happy no strangers have tried to touch my stomach yet. Iâm very ticklish. This is one of my sillier worries.

I worry, a lot. Not as much now as in the first trimester, when the chance of miscarrying is about 25%, but I still worry about doing everything right. Am I getting enough protein? Am I eating too much vitamin A? Are these eggs cooked enough? Is this meat too pink? Is my seatbelt low enough? Am I exercising too hard? Have I gained enough weight? Have I gained too much? Is this organic? Is this feta cheese pasteurized? Whatâs scary is that you can do everything right and things can still go horribly wrong. That lack of control over our circumstances causes a lot of anxiety.

Preoccupied with the pregnancy, Iâll often forget in a few months, I'll be a mom. When I remember,I get all excited thinking about holding the baby, singing to the baby, playing with the baby. And then thereâs a moment of terror when I realize I know nothing about taking care of a baby. I have no idea how to change a diaper. I took a babysitting course when I was 12, but Iâve never done it on a real, living child before. Iâm sure Iâll learn that and the billion other things that will simultaneously amaze and disgust me. 

Every prenatal yoga video Iâve done so far starts with a meditation to âconnect with your baby.â And I sit there thinking, how much more connected can we get? Itâs taken over my body and my mind! I suppose I still think of it as a parasite more than a baby most of the time. That will change. Being pregnant is OK, but mostly, I canât wait until I finally get to meet this little person.",Thinking for Two,,,,,,

Now in the second trimester, things have gotten a little better. my thoughts have moved to - I am so hungry. I have to peeâ¦ again. Do I look pregnant yet? What can I wear that still fits... Was that the baby moving? â¦ Was that the baby moving?
Itâs not just me thinking about baby. Every conversation I have starts the same way: âHow are you feeling? Howâs the baby?â. Good, um, you know, itâs still in there. Do I know the gender? No, not yet. And if the conversation goes on long enough, it will inevitably turn to my bowel movements. â...Are you constipated?â No, thanks for asking.  Iâm just happy no strangers have tried to touch my stomach yet. Iâm very ticklish. This is one of my sillier worries.

I worry, a lot. Not as much now as in the first trimester, when the chance of miscarrying is about 25%, but I still worry about doing everything right. Am I getting enough protein? Am I eating too much vitamin A? Are these eggs cooked enough? Is this meat too pink? Is my seatbelt low enough? Am I exercising too hard? Have I gained enough weight? Have I gained too much? Is this organic? Is this feta cheese pasteurized? Whatâs scary is that you can do everything right and things can still go horribly wrong. That lack of control over our circumstances causes a lot of anxiety.

Preoccupied with the pregnancy, Iâll often forget in a few months, I'll be a mom. When I remember,I get all excited thinking about holding the baby, singing to the baby, playing with the baby. And then thereâs a moment of terror when I realize I know nothing about taking care of a baby. I have no idea how to change a diaper. I took a babysitting course when I was 12, but Iâve never done it on a real, living child before. Iâm sure Iâll learn that and the billion other things that will simultaneously amaze and disgust me. 

Every prenatal yoga video Iâve done so far starts with a meditation to âconnect with your baby.â And I sit there thinking, how much more connected can we get? Itâs taken over my body and my mind! I suppose I still think of it as a parasite more than a baby most of the time. That will change. Being pregnant is OK, but mostly, I canât wait until I finally get to meet this little person.",Thinking for Two,,,,,,
5/16/2014 12:06,5/16/2014 16:06,"In a few hours, we'll hopefully find out if our little one is a boy or a girl.

Up until a couple years ago, I insisted our future child was going to be a girl. I wouldn't entertain the notion that we had a 50% chance of having a boy. Nope. Definitely was going to be a girl. This changed when I was in the local Christmas musical and I remembered that 12 year old girls are perhaps, the most obnoxious beings on the entire planet. Having a boy no longer seemed so bad.

I've spent the past few months trying my best to convince myself we're having a boy and that boys are better than girls. Yesterday, I was thinking, I feel like I know if it's a boy or a girl, but I don't know what I know. If only I had some clear, intuitive insight, like a dream, that would tell me.

Of course I had a dream that we're having an adorable baby girl. And I can clearly picture our son reading this 10 years from now going, wtf mom! :) I'll be happy either way, just want a healthy baby who at least tolerates show tunes.

Still, I feel very anxious about our appointment. I feel like knowing makes the whole thing very real. Up until today it's been an ""it"" and all of a sudden, it's going to have some sort of identity, some insight into who this person is going to be. Freaks me out. I feel like we have so much to do before the baby gets here - registering, getting the nursery ready, getting my home office ready, remodeling the bathroom downstairs, classes to learn basic things like how to hold a baby. How does time go by so fast?

Stay tuned for the big news...

My eating behaviors are socially acceptable. People expect me to be hungry and stuffing my face all the time now. In fact, I'll often get food shoved in my face. It's a little awesome. This hasn't happened yet, but if someone makes something awful, I have an excellent excuse not to eat it: oh, sorry, not loving that right now, must be a pregnancy thing.

Also, I'm not peeing that much more than usual, more like, it's just more urgent than usual, but people expect me to have to pee a lot now, so I can totally get up in the middle of a meeting to go to the bathroom and not feel weird about it.

I have an excuse to randomly nap during the day. Also, to veg out after work and not do any chores. Didn't get my 10,000 steps in today? It's OK, I'm taking it easy today. Don't want to take the stairs? That's cool too.

Walk into a meeting and all the chairs are taken, two people offer up their seats and I don't have to feel guilty about taking one.

Conversations with acquaintances are less awkward. People have something to talk to me about.

My hair looks really good. My skin too. This is the longest I've gone without a breakout since being on antibiotics before our wedding.

I don't freak outÂ when my pants don't fit.

Shopping for baby clothes. Haven't bought any yet besides the Disney onesie, but it's fun to look.

Baby moving - definitely the most fun part. I can sit and watch him bump around in there for the longest time. It's very relaxing.  

In other news - I had a happy birthday filled with a lot of food, friends and family :) My coworkers treated me to lunch at this great pizza place and we had a party yesterday at our house. I made these oreo ice cream cheesecake balls that I didn't put out because they were too yummy and I want them all to myself. 

Saturday, Bryan's family had a little reunion at Nana's and there was a giant bar of chocolate. Though I mostly stuck to the cookies.

6/9/2014 15:29,6/9/2014 19:29,"I've written about the not so fun parts of pregnancy, but it's not all bad. Here are some of the things I've been enjoying:

My eating behaviors are socially acceptable. People expect me to be hungry and stuffing my face all the time now. In fact, I'll often get food shoved in my face. It's a little awesome. This hasn't happened yet, but if someone makes something awful, I have an excellent excuse not to eat it: oh, sorry, not loving that right now, must be a pregnancy thing.

Also, I'm not peeing that much more than usual, more like, it's just more urgent than usual, but people expect me to have to pee a lot now, so I can totally get up in the middle of a meeting to go to the bathroom and not feel weird about it.

I have an excuse to randomly nap during the day. Also, to veg out after work and not do any chores. Didn't get my 10,000 steps in today? It's OK, I'm taking it easy today. Don't want to take the stairs? That's cool too.

Walk into a meeting and all the chairs are taken, two people offer up their seats and I don't have to feel guilty about taking one.

Conversations with acquaintances are less awkward. People have something to talk to me about.

My hair looks really good. My skin too. This is the longest I've gone without a breakout since being on antibiotics before our wedding.

I don't freak outÂ when my pants don't fit.

Shopping for baby clothes. Haven't bought any yet besides the Disney onesie, but it's fun to look.

Baby moving - definitely the most fun part. I can sit and watch him bump around in there for the longest time. It's very relaxing.  

In other news - I had a happy birthday filled with a lot of food, friends and family :) My coworkers treated me to lunch at this great pizza place and we had a party yesterday at our house. I made these oreo ice cream cheesecake balls that I didn't put out because they were too yummy and I want them all to myself. 

Saturday, Bryan's family had a little reunion at Nana's and there was a giant bar of chocolate.

Still feeling alright. My biggest challenge lately is eating. Normally I can fit quite a bit of food in my stomach, and I forget that I have limited space now. I've gotten better though. I just have to remind myself to stop eating long before I'm full, take the rest home and have it later. I also found I have much more room earlier in the day, so I have my regular breakfast, split up between before and after my workout and then second breakfast (lunch) at 10:30 :)

I finally ordered a desk and Bryan put it together for me :) I also filled out my work from home agreement, so I'm all set for when I can no longer drive! 

We also bought a new sink, toilet, tile and paint for the bathroom downstairs. Really hoping that's done by the baby shower on he 26th.

Been trying to get an exterminator to come out because we think we may have termites. Yup, it never ends. 

Continuing training at work. Real work has been light, so I've been involved in these hackathons. I don't us expect to win anything, just in it for the learning experience.

7/12/2014 13:34,7/12/2014 17:34,"We don't have termites! We just have ants and not carpenter ants, just pavement ants. That dust by the door is just dirt and ant bodies. Ew. 

And our bathroom is done! Even had a local guy do it on the cheap and so glad wee took the risk because it looks great! And the floor doesn't move anymore, whoot! 

Last night, Ellen had a PJ. So enjoyed all the food, especially the sweets. I had been avoiding them all week due to my glucose test Thursday. That is so not how I would ever choose to consume my sugar for the week, but it wasn't too bad. Hopefully I won't have to do the three hour test. The screening gives a false positive over half the time. Such BS.

Ellen is a really good cook. Everything she made was delicious and there were veggies too, so guilt free goodies :) We chatted about all sorts of stuff and baby entertained everyone by moving around, lol.

As far as I know, baby and I are doing well. Everything seems to be measuring right and growing as it should. Sleeping is getting harder due to leg cramps and general uncomfyness, but otherwise I still feel good. My shower is in a couple weeks. Been stalking our registry, but there are few items bought so far :( I don't want to sound spoiled, but there's an overwhelming amount of stuff we really need. I hope we get some of it as gifts.

Bryan's parents were kind enough to purchase our nursery furniture :D very excited about that. At least the really big stuff is taken care of!

There's this mobilithon that took place over the course of the last two weeks. It sucked because I was the only one with time to work on the app. I did the best I could, but it's not all that thrilling. It's extremely unlikely that we'll win.

The other, was a CDT event that took place over the course of two days last week. We did nothing but work on the app those two days as a team, so it was much more fun. We used a drag and drop tool since some of our team didn't code, but the thing had its own learning curve. In the end, we had a pretty good idea and a solid app. Unfortunately the judging was done based on a three minute presentation and the team that won, it turns out, bought their template from somewhere? Oh so I've been told. Either way, I didn't think ours was the best, but I was proud of it and our presentation. Oh and it turns out, half our team is pregnant :D and the other half has kids. We should have been ""the mommies.""

In between this madness was baby shower #1. We got quite a lot of useful/fun baby gear and had enough food to feed a small army. If I was measuring small, I don't think I am anymore :p I gained four pounds this last week. Oh those cupcakes! Many thanks to Bryan's mommy and mine. Lyn is the artist behind the fruit baby.

And my 32 week pic from today.

How are you feeling? - still pretty good!
When is the baby due again? - September 27th
Boy or girl? - Boy
Do you have any names picked out? - ...

So, we had a girl name that we liked. We decided on that years ago. Boys names are harder. Most boy names are either common and boring or weird and will get him beat up in school. There have been several times we decided we liked a name, only to change our minds weeks later. Bryan never liked my top two names :P

My primary criteria: my son will not share a name with anyone I went to high school with. And although we considered several character's names from our favorite works of fiction, we decided against all of those too.

We do have a name that's growing on us right now. It bubbled up from my subconscious in the middle of the night one night as all brilliant ideas do. It's not common, but it's not weird either. There are several people on the planet with the name and characters in shows, but no one we have any emotional connection with. 

However, he will not get a name until he comes out. We still have two months to decide. Also, we don't want to tell anyone the name until he's born to avoid the,""oh, you're naming him that?"" Which is a reaction I've gotten to several of our reject names. You can't please everyone. 

So yes, we have some ideas for names, but we're not telling, so don't ask :P

Then I have the work shower on Wednesday. I see my doctor on Tuesday and we have an interview with a pediatrician on Friday. Busy week!

Since then, we've been trying to figure out if he's turned or not. You'd think it'd be easy to tell. Mysterious large bumps will emerge on different areas of my tummy. Kicks and hiccups are felt everywhere. I have no idea which way he's facing.

Ishrat insisted everyone touch my belly, which was as awkward as it looks. I'll post pictures from the friends shower once Julia posts them :) Everyone has been very generous. I can't believe I was worried about people not buying stuff off our registry. I did the registry completion on Amazon and Babies R Us, the cash gifts we received were enough to cover everything left. I haven't had to spend any of our own money on this kid so far and he has so much stuff! 

Pretty much the only stuff we didn't get was anything related to cloth diapering, lol. OK, I get it, you don't think we'll stick with it. Challenge accepted! I've done so much research on cloth diapers, there's no way I'm not putting some effort into this. Plus, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Rumparooz-Cloth-Diaper-Cover-Kangarooz/dp/B006WR01G8/ref=br_it_dp_o_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=OPPQSHXMRR8D&coliid=I2EX3MG886TQ9L"">look at dem</a>! I've bought all different kinds to see what we like best.

Baby was head down as of our last ultrasound. Hopefully he stays that way. I met the third doctor in the practice at my last appointment. She giggled a lot, ""he's as big as you are!"" I mentioned the sharp pains I've felt in my pelvis when he moves. She says he's moving down. He's definitely dropped some. I thought I might get off stretch mark free, no such luck. I guess he stretched my lower belly because as of a few days ago, I have a stretch splotch down there. I can only see it if I look in the mirror though :D My lower belly really itches too. On the bright side, he can't reach my ribs anymore. 

All in all, this pregnancy thing, not too bad. Actually I've enjoyed it quite a bit. Sure I could have done without the nausea, fatigue, gas and being asked the same damn questions every single day, but otherwise it's been pretty fun. Feeling him move around in there, shopping for baby things and perfectly clear skin have been my favorite perks :) Glad I haven't experienced much back pain, heartburn or mood swings. No swelling, constipation or sciatica. I'd do it again. Well, let's see how this whole labor and raising a child thing goes first.

Baby can come any day now. Just waiting. Been extra hormonal lately. Hard to sleep because there's just no room in there for anything besides baby. Haven't gained much weight the last couple of weeks, probably because there's no where for it to go... Otherwise, still feeling good. No swelling, no extreme discomfort. Still exercising, though forward bends and squats aren't really happening anymore.

They kept getting more intense until the point I woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep again. Tuesday night, I was in a lot of pain and the contractions were&nbsp; close together, but irregular. I called the doctor to ask what I should do and she said it didn't sound like I was in labor, wait 30 minutes and go to the hospital if I felt it necessary. The contractions became less frequent, so I waited.

Wednesday, I was in pain all day and the contractions were coming at least every 8 minutes, but still irregular. By 4:30, they were pretty bad so we went to the hospital.

The staff was sure I'd be pretty far along based on how strong my contractions were, but I was only 1cm. The doctor suggested we induce, so we did. The contractions became absolutely unbearable. After a couple hours though, I was still only 2cm. I asked for the epidural. Let me tell ya, that's good stuff. They had to turn off the pictocin at one point because the baby's hr dropped, but my contractions were strong without it. The next time they checked, I was 8cm.

Pushing took forever, mostly because I couldn't feel anything down there and my contractions weren't very close together. They turned down the drugs which helped. The doctor came in at the very end. She wanted to do an episiotomy on me, but I said no, unless absolutely necessary. She was pretty judgemental about it when I tore, but it's supposed to make tearing worse, so poo poo on her.

Anyway, the last few pushes were pretty brutal. Kid's got a big head. But he was out! They cleaned him up and gave him to me. I tried breastfeeding and he took to it right away.

I was finally able to rest. When I wasn't feeding him anyway. He looooves to eat. Especially when he's upset and needs comfort. 

We were all ready to go home Saturday morning when the pediatrician told us he's jaundiced and had to stay another night. I was so upset, especially because they took him away for treatment and told us they need to give him formula to help flush his system. They have me a pump to keep up my supply.

I was incredibly relieved when they brought him in a little while later to eat.
That night without him was rough though. Pumping is terrible. The next day, his test results looked promising. We hung out at the hospital with him all day. The afternoon results looked good too. We were finally able to bring him home!

And I haven't slept since. Naw, that's a slight exageration, but it's a happy sleep deprivation. Absolutely love him and love being a mom. Even when I'm being peed on.

They kept getting more intense until the point I woke up at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep again. Tuesday night, I was in a lot of pain and the contractions were&nbsp; close together, but irregular. I called the doctor to ask what I should do and she said it didn't sound like I was in labor, wait 30 minutes and go to the hospital if I felt it necessary. The contractions became less frequent, so I waited.

Wednesday, I was in pain all day and the contractions were coming at least every 8 minutes, but still irregular. By 4:30, they were pretty bad so we went to the hospital.

The staff was sure I'd be pretty far along based on how strong my contractions were, but I was only 1cm. The doctor suggested we induce, so we did. The contractions became absolutely unbearable. After a couple hours though, I was still only 2cm. I asked for the epidural. Let me tell ya, that's good stuff. They had to turn off the pictosin at one point because the baby's hr dropped, but my contractions were strong without it. The next time they checked, I was 8cm.

Pushing took forever, mostly because I couldn't feel anything down there and my contractions weren't very close together. They turned down the drugs which helped. The doctor came in at the very end. She wanted to do an episiotimy, but I said no, unless absolutely necessary. She was pretty judgemental about it when I tore, but it's supposed to make tearing worse, so poo poo on her.

Anyway, the last few pushes were pretty brutal. Kid's got a big head. But he was out! They cleaned him up and gave him to me. I tried breastfeeding and he took to it right away.

7lbs 12oz, 20 3/4"" long

I was finally able to rest. When I wasn't feeding him anyway. He looooves to eat. Especially when he's upset and needs comfort. 

We were all ready to go home Saturday morning when the pediatrician told us he's jaundiced and had to stay another night. I was so upset, especially because they took him away for treatment and told us they need to give him formula to help flush his system. They have me a pump to keep up my supply.

I was incredibly relieved when they brought him in a little while later to eat.
That night without him was rough though. Pumping is terrible. The next day, his test results looked promising. We hung out at the hospital with him all day. The afternoon results looked good too. We were finally able to bring him home!

And I haven't slept since. Naw, that's a slight exageration, but it's a happy sleep deprivation. Absolutely love him and love being a mom. Even when I'm being peed on.

10/17/2014 17:53,10/17/2014 21:53,"So being a mom is pretty awesome. Our son is twenty kinds of adorable. I even get excited about changing poopy diapers because I can record a poop and many poops means he's getting enough food. It's like points in a game. Plus, the cloth diapers are awesome. We were having crazy leak problems with disposables, but none so far with cloth. Btw, breastfed baby poop actually smells pleasant.

Breastfeeding is simultaneously the best and worst part of taking care a newborn. He sucks, we bond, he makes cute noises, he's comforted and gets all the nutrients he needs. But then he flails around and hits me and tries to grab my nipple and then he screams if he loses the latch and he doesn't latch good, so ouch. And, oh yeah, sleep deprivation. Then there's the part where I spent $200 on a lactation consultant and $500 to get his tongue tie, which may or may not have been a thing, taken care of. But he's gaining weight and pooping - win.

Speaking of other countries and the awesome people that live there, my Canadian buddy, <a href=""http://just-like-magic.org"">Carolynne</a> just welcome her little girl into the world, congrats!

So, six weeks. Owen started social smiling which is just about the cutest thing ever. He's imitating faces too and gets a kick out of it when he sticks his tongue out and then I do it. He's also a very cranky baby. Fourth trimester, gas, sleepiness, who knows, but there's no problem that can't be solved by the boob. No idea what will happen when I go back to work. Pumping is still a problem, mostly because he eats all day. He's finally sleeping now, so I'm pumping as I write this.

What else... He can roll over onto his back sometimes. He didn't cry when we gave him a bath yesterday. I think he liked the fact he had an audience. He likes to entertain.

He has blocked tear ducts and developed a but of an eye infection last week's, but he got drops and now he's all better. Poor little guy, he's had jaundice, reflux, baby acne, blocked tear ducts. At least all minor stuff. No wonder he's so cranky though.

Really, I can't believe his stomach is that big and even more amazing, my books make that much milk.

Pumping has gotten a little better. I'm now getting an average of 2.5oz a day. Enough to build up a supply. If he wants to eat all day, I just pump on one side while he eats from the other. This morning, he's sleeping, so I got it all in one, easy shot. 

He's sleeping, I should really be cleaning or something...

He coos a lot. He love the pictures above his changing table and will tell you about it or that he has a poppie diaper.

Pumping has gotten a little better. I'm now getting an average of 2.5oz a day. Enough to build up a supply. If he wants to eat all day, I just pump on one side while he eats from the other. This morning, he's sleeping, so I got it all in one, easy shot. 

He's sleeping, I should really be cleaning or something...

He coos a lot. He love the pictures above his changing table and will tell you about it or that he has a poppie diaper.

He was so interested in all the things and was smiling at people. Since then he seems to have his days and nights pretty much straightened out, though I'm not really getting more sleep since he has his long sleep early.

It's ok, he's adorable. He smiled at his reflection today and squealed with delight at his Pooh art while I was changing his diaper. He was making funny faces with grandma yesterday :) He's also more into toys and will grab at them now.

We took him to the mall last week. He loved it! All the things! I think he gets bored at home sometimes. Such an ordeal taking him out though, especially since he's the only baby who doesn't love car rides. We did put on Christmas music on the way home from the mall which, combined with his exhaustion, lulled him into a sleep. Going to try taking him to Kohls maybe today.

He laughs and grabs at toys now. This morning we were playing with his giraffe and he was smiling! Speaking of smiles, this morning he was sleeping and I saw he kicked off his blanket. I went over to him and he was awake a looked very distressed. He saw me and flashed me the biggest smile :) 

I also showed him his baby artwork book this morning which brought out an ""oooooh."" And read him the story of the gingerbread man which he seemed to really enjoy.

Yesterday wasn't as good. His reflux was bad and I couldn't get him to nap. He sleeps really well at night, he's been doing at least a five hour stretch every night, but naps have been tough. Ice been letting him sleep on me so he sleeps at all, but I really have to pee right now and my arm is asleep.

I actually prefer he wakes up once during the night, otherwise I need to get up and pump and the pump doesn't put me back to sleep like he does :-/",Twelve Weeks,,,,,,

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn't have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents'. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian';s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She's a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&'s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn't have a mortgage then. As long as we don't go crazy buying shit we don't need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the New Black and Downton Abbey. 
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.

2014-2015
Let's see this year I found out I was pregnant, announced I was pregnant, had many baby showers, gave birth, hung out with the cutest little guy ever for three months. We also went to Disney and I did much training at work in preparation for changing assignments. 
This year I watched an awful lot of Star Trek. Bryan and I watched all of DS9 together, then when Owen was born we watched all of TNG and we're currently going through Voyager. They hold up better than I thought they would. TNG is best overall,  DS9 has the best story arc and Voyager is the funniest.
Today was my first day back in the office. I was too preoccupied with pumping to get much done, but I don't have any real work to do anyway and no one was there to give me anything to do. I showed Maryam the training project I made up. I wish I were more creative and could think of something better than a quiz app to make.
Tonight I will probably go to sleep early since I've been up at 2:30am. Not Owen's fault, he slept 7 hours last night and then another 4 1/2. He had us cracking up during his feeding, and then he has no idea why we're laughing, so he just looks at us like we're crazy and then smiles nervously which of course makes us laugh more. Love him.",New Years Past,,,,,,

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae&#039;s birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I&#039;ve read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn't have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian&#039;s and my parents'. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian';s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She's a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&'s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I&#039;ve been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I&#039;ve been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I&#039;ve been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I&#039;m making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn't have a mortgage then. As long as we don't go crazy buying shit we don't need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the New Black and Downton Abbey. 
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.

1/18/2015 2:24,1/18/2015 7:24,"It's been a tough couple of weeks. Really, we can't believe it's only been a couple of weeks. Owen has been super fussy during the day and at least he was sleeping through the night, bit he's not anymore! Bryan was sleeping with him in the basement, but he got sick, so I took over a few days. We decided to move him to the bedroom because neither of us was keen on sleeping down there. He never stays asleep the first time I put him down though, so I've been sleeping with him on his crib mattress on the floor :-/ it's about as comfortable as it sounds. And he still much rather sleep with me in the chair. Me too baby, me too. Chair's more dangerous though. Oh yeah, then I was sick. Not long, but it was the first sick day I ever took.
At his last Dr appt, Owen hadn't gained quite enough weight, so I'm almost glad he wakes up to feed more often now. We've also been giving him some bottles during the day, though it's hard to balance that with making sure he's still breastfeeding well do my milk supply doesn't decrease even more. He's very impatient.
We saw the lactation consultant again who insisted his tongue tie reattached. The dentist basically told us she's crazy, that can't happen. Wherever, didn't want to put him through that procedure again anyways. Just frustrating when there's no clear cut answer. As a control freak, this dives me crazy. 
So yeah, things have been a little rough. On top of all that, I actually have to work and breastfeed and pump after I breastfeed while working but staying relaxed so the milk will flow. This is why people give their babies formula.

OK, when Bryan was sick and I was sick, it was that bad, and he's had some awful days, but otherwise we've been OK. Especially since I learned a trick to get him to eat nice when he's cranky - squats while nursing. Sometimes when he's real tired, that'll knock him out. He looks chubbier, we'll see how much weight he's gained Friday.

The past couple of weeks have been better. Owen is really starting to develop a little personality and can go long stretches without a meltdown. He was even socializing with my parents the other day rather than screaming at the top of his lungs. He smiles a lot more now, tries to communicate in ways other than crying. He effectively ""told"" me his diaper was dirty this morning and seemed to understand when I asked ""do you need your diapy changed?"" He likes to do sit-ups and when we tickle him, even though he's not ticklish. He loves looking at computer screens and seemed to recognize his picture (my wallpaper).

I just wish he would sleep. He'll do a seven hour stretch or a five hour stretch one night and then wake up every hour the next night. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to the pattern. Better naps do not seem to mean better nighttime sleep. If anything, when he naps well during the day, he wants to stay up later. 

Work's been pretty good. Learning the code. It's so readable, it's amazing. Cleanest code ever. The team seems friendly and helpful. Looking forward to actually contributing.

He still wakes up at least two or three times at night, but when he smiles, I don't care. I actually enjoy spending that extra time with him. Owen giggles are pretty much the best sound ever.

Other adorable Owenness:

When he's hungry, he goes ""mmmmm!"" And reaches for us.

When he has to burp, he pulls off and looks like he's going to barf.

Oh my gosh, the cutest burps, farts and sneezes.

When he wants to play, he flashes the biggest smiles.

He tries to stuff Sophie the giraffe and his keyboard in his mouth at the same time.

He likes to help mommy with chores and type on her keyboard and phone.

I don't know what on my linked in profile would make them think I'd be interested in that, but still mildly flattered, because, you know, Google. I really have the best job in the world right now though, as far as work/life balance goes. Yes, I'm a little distracted working at home, but I think I'm more distracted in the office on Wednesdays. Everyone has to go in on Wednesdays so that's when we have all of our in person meetings, events and hallway gatherings. Work doesn't happen. 

Fortunately I haven't been too busy. I have just enough work that there's something for me to do every day, but not even to keep me 100% occupied. Been reading code and taking training. My new team is super nice. So glad I got this assignment and not ISAAC again. The past few weeks have made me feel really grateful for everything I learned in RUBY and ISAAC. Once you're level 2, people expect you to know things and I know the things, it's a nice place to be. Plus I'm learning new things like Maven, Jenkins, Rest services. I wish I was actually doing mobile client development, but there's no work for that right now. Did I mention I'm working on ATT's Mark the Spot app? You all should download it for your phones.

I finished our taxes. We're getting a big refund this year. Mostly because we made way less money this year + Owen. What's interesting though is that even though we made a lot less money and we added a member to our family, we actually saved a whole $1000 more in 2014 than 2013. Go us! I think it's time I buy some new clothes since I've been wearing the same 3 outfits over and over. I was thinking about signing up at <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/referral/3039521"">StitchFix </a>since I don't really have time to shop, but the clothes I've seen from them are so boring. Maybe I need some boring clothes though.

For sure I will be cutting my hair. It's everywhere, everywhere! I am constantly picking hairs off of Owen, my clothes, my food. It's gotten really long and he pulls at it, tries to eat it and spits up on it. I'm done. Just need to find time to go to the hair salon... ",Life Other Than Baby,,,,,,

Visited his parents yesterday, at my parents' right now. Owen has been sleeping on my lap for an hour and a half. I have to pee. He didn't sleep well last night, poor baby.

Carolyn's shower was last weekend. We may have gone overboard with the regifting. My guess the poo game was a hit though. Not as big of a hit as Owen. He's the life of every party.

He weighed in two pounds heavier at his Dr appt. This kid can't get enough food lately. I think I'm making more milk, but we still need to supplement a bit. 

He's enjoying his oatmeal a lot now and rather liked his sweet potatoes. He can pass objects from one hand to the other and excels at grabbing and throwing things. I chopped off my hair, he manages to pull it still, but not as bad. It's kinda cute when he plays with it.

3/8/2015 15:34,3/8/2015 19:34,"Bryan and I have been together 9 years. Crazy. Drove through Rutgers yesterday and we couldn't believe how much older we are than the students now. 

Visited his parents yesterday, at my parents' right now. Owen has been sleeping on my lap for an hour and a half. I have to pee. He didn't sleep well last night, poor baby.

Carolyn's shower was last weekend. We may have gone overboard with the regifting. My guess the poo game was a hit though. Not as big of a hit as Owen. He's the life of every party.

He weighed in two pounds heavier at his Dr appt. This kid can't get enough food lately. I think I'm making more milk, but we still need to supplement a bit.

You bring him in the nursery and down on the changing table. He's happier already. By the time the diaper cover is off, he's stopped crying. You put a new one on and place him in his crib while you wash up. When you come back, he's smiling and wants to play.

You bring him downstairs and he plays gravity (throws toys off his high chair) while you eat your overnight oats and make tea. You leave your tea downstairs to steep while you go bring him back up. You place him in the crib so you can potty, but he protests. You tell him you'll be right back and you are. You attempt to nurse him back to sleep. 
This isn't going well. He's very uncomfortable. Grunting and passing gas, most likely working on a poop. You peddle his legs and sing I've been working on the railroad while he hangs his head upside down off your legs. You nurse again. He's falling asleep. Nope, crying again. More peddling. You smell him just in case, he's had some stealthy poops lately, but he's fresh as a daisy. You switch sides once more. He's finally nodding off for real, you know because he's smiling in his sleep. Maybe you'll get to exercise after all this morning. You attempt to put him back to bed.",,,,,,,

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg""><img class="" alignleft"" title=""20150326_064820.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""241"" height=""428"" /></a>

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts.

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself.Â  <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436.jpg""><img class="" size-medium wp-image-4756 alignright"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436-169x300.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_070436.jpg"" width=""169"" height=""300"" /></a>

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little.

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday, looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you.

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back about svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attention. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps.

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Owen's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tests. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_141539.jpg""><img class=""  aligncenter"" title=""20150326_141539.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_141539.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""1077"" height=""606"" /></a>

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs.

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep.

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4772"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953-576x1024.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_153710.jpg"" width=""576"" height=""1024"" /></a>

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and how getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again.

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_163855.jpg""><img class=""  alignright"" title=""20150326_163855.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_163855.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""194"" height=""345"" /></a>

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably your request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You reconnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there!

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now.

You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg""><img class=""  alignleft"" title=""20150326_182006.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""121"" height=""215"" /></a>

He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm, Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read Peek-a-Who? together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You sing him the sleepy Owen song. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do some squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle.

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, spread across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is swimming with thoughts, but you soon find them blurring and slipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, still asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep.

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again. Really quickly actually. That was super easy. You read more of the book sample and then quietly back to bed.

Two hours later, you're awoken again. You take him to the mattress and you both fall asleep cuddled together. You wake up and see Bryan sneaking in. You wake up again at 4 and switch sides and again at 5:30. You can't nurse him back to sleep at that point and you've had enough sleep, so you get up and change his diaper. That was a very good night. Owen touches your hair and holds your thumb. You melt a little. ""Mommy loves you.""

3/27/2015 10:11,3/27/2015 14:11,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg""><img class="" alignleft"" title=""20150326_064820.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""241"" height=""428"" /></a>

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts.

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself.Â  <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436.jpg""><img class="" size-medium wp-image-4756 alignright"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436-169x300.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_070436.jpg"" width=""169"" height=""300"" /></a>

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little.

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday, looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you.

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back about svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attention. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_110825.jpg""><img class=""  aligncenter"" title=""20150326_110825.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_110825.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""1229"" height=""691"" /></a>

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Owen's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tests. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-2015-03-27-07.49.18.jpg.jpeg""><img class=""  aligncenter"" title=""2015-03-27 07.49.18.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-2015-03-27-07.49.18.jpg.jpeg"" alt=""image"" width=""345"" height=""460"" /></a>

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_141539.jpg""><img class=""  aligncenter"" title=""20150326_141539.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_141539.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""1077"" height=""606"" /></a>

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs.

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep.

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4772"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953-576x1024.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_153710.jpg"" width=""576"" height=""1024"" /></a>

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and how getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again.

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard.
<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_163855.jpg""><img class=""  alignright"" title=""20150326_163855.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_163855.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""194"" height=""345"" /></a>

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably your request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You reconnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there!

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now.

You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg""><img class=""  alignleft"" title=""20150326_182006.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""121"" height=""215"" /></a>

He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm, Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read Peek-a-Who? together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

He was sleeping horribly most of the week, but last night was pretty good. I woke up a few times and he was still out. We're still talking 1-2 hour increments of sleep, but that's a lot better than waking every 20 minutes. Â I don't care, I slept great last night.

He's spitting up less and less these days and the drool has subsided a little. I think the teething/drooling was causing a lot of gas.

Oh and he's learned to splash in the bathtub. Bath time has gotten much wetter.

5/1/2015 12:54,5/1/2015 16:54,"Somehow he's gotten even worse at sleeping. We're thinking it's the solids upsetting his tummy. Gripe water seems to help sometimes. We cosleep, but every time he wakes up, he wakes up crying and insists we sit up and switch sides before falling back asleep. I've been getting around four hours every night. I could get more, if I slept the last stretch he does, but I can never fall back asleep, plus it's the only me time I get X( We have good nights every once in a while. I'm surviving. In the meantime, still enjoying spending that time with him because I know he won't always be like this.

He still hates tummy time, so crawling isn't something he'll be doing in the immediate future, but he loves to sit p right and scoot himself towards his target.

Work hasn't been so good. The org I'm working for is still having funding issues, so not only do I have to leave another scrum team, I'll no longer be doing mobile development either ;( Unless the funding comes real soon. Meanwhile, I had my choice of projects I don't want to work on. Pretty much vague developer position or automated testing developer. I picked he mystery position. So glad I spent all of last year learning mobile development. Ah well, happy to have a good job that allows both of us to be home with Owen.

7/25/2015 6:07,7/25/2015 10:07,"He's going to be a toddler before I know it. He's been getting into all kinds of trouble this month. He's up the stairs in a flash every chance he gets, climbing into the dishwasher, getting into drawers. Yesterday he was standing on the bench chewing on the top of his pack n play and doing pull-ups on the baby gate.

His sleep is steadily getting a little better. He flips onto his tummy now when he's done eating and sometimes does two hour stretches. 

Carolyn texted me Connor's bedtime routine: bath, book, boob, bed. This was my response:
We do bath, diaper, jump on the bed, say goodnight to all the things, try to read book, boob, book, boob, book, boob, bed, cry, boob, crawl all over mommy, cry, boob, crawl, cry, boob, roll over onto tummy, cry, boob, roll onto tummy, repeat x 10, sleep

Started wearing him on my back since he's getting pretty heavy. He seems ok with it, though it makes him a little sleepy.

He's had a couple of play dates with his new buddy, Nolan, who lives in the next set of houses over. Super convenient.

Had a girls brunch earlier this month. Was nice to get out and see my friends. Carolyn and Connor came over yesterday. The looks Connor gave Owen were priceless. The funny thing is he's six months younger, but they're nearly the same size. Big little dude, and so cute!

4/10/2015 16:11,4/10/2015 20:11,"Better late than never. The DIL post sort of took the place of the six month post.

Owen has two adorable wittle teeth on the bottom now and more are coming in on the top. They are adorable and dangerous. Â I can't believe he hasn't drawn blood yet the way he bites down on my hand. He also smacks his lips, now a lot. We think he's intimating kissing. Â He loves when we give him kisses, especially if there's tickling involved and he loves when he makes the noise and we make it back. He's getting very good at sitting up on his own, passing objects between hands, throwing things, though still has trouble rolling over.

He has excellent comedic timing. He constantly cracks us up. You'll ask him a question and he'll respond with a fart or a burp. Then we laugh and he looks so concerned. He doesn't seem to understand why we laugh, though he does it all the time. Mostly when we tickle him or threaten to tickle or I growl at him...

Trying to savor every moment, but they're going by so quickly. I actually enjoy being up with him at night. He's so sweet when he's sleepy AND actually wants to sleep. He fights it so much during the day. He doesn't really seem to ""get"" the whole sleep thing. He knows he doesn't feel good, but doesn't understand that sleeping will make it better. He also doesn't have the slightest clue that if he just relaxes and closes his eyes, he'll probably fall asleep. We haven't even attempted to move him to his crib. Enjoying co-sleeping while it's still cute. We both actually get sleep that way, so I say, win. I just wish there wasn't so much drama every time he wakes up. Instead of cuddling in and nursing back to sleep, we have to sit up, get situated in my lap, maybe pass some gas, and then we can cuddle and go back to sleep.

He doesn't sleep on me as much during the day, mostly because he has better naps in the swing now. I miss it, but it's nice to have two free hands for working. Working has gotten much easier since he spends less time eating and sleeping on me and I don't have to focus so hard on pumping when I'm in the office anymore.

I did get switched to this new scrum team, but this work is more interesting and I think I'll learn more here. I don't know if I'm allowed to promote the app I'm working on. I assume I am, but just in case, I won't say until after it's released which will be very soon.

A few days ago, Owen's soon to be bestest friend was born! Congrats Carolyn and Tom and welcome to the world Baby Connor!

Owen has two adorable wittle teeth on the bottom now and more are coming in on the top. They are adorable and dangerous. Â I can't believe he hasn't drawn blood yet the way he bites down on my hand. He also smacks his lips, now a lot. We think he's intimating kissing. Â He loves when we give him kisses, especially if there's tickling involved and he loves when he makes the noise and we make it back. He's getting very good at sitting up on his own, passing objects between hands, throwing things, though still has trouble rolling over.

He has excellent comedic timing. He constantly cracks us up. You'll ask him a question and he'll respond with a fart or a burp. Then we laugh and he looks so concerned. He doesn't seem to understand why we laugh, though he does it all the time. Mostly when we tickle him or threaten to tickle or I growl at him...

Trying to savor every moment, but they're going by so quickly. I actually enjoy being up with him at night. He's so sweet when he's sleepy AND actually wants to sleep. He fights it so much during the day. He doesn't really seem to ""get"" the whole sleep thing. He knows he doesn't feel good, but doesn't understand that sleeping will make it better.

He doesn't sleep on me as much during the day, mostly because he has better naps in the swing now. I miss it, but it's nice to have two free hands for working. Working has gotten much easier since he spends less time eating and sleeping on me and I don't have to focus so hard on pumping when I'm in the office anymore.

I did get switched to this new scrum team, but this work is more interesting and I think I'll learn more here. I don't know if I'm allowed to promote the app I'm working on. I assume I am, but just in case, I won't say until after it's released which will be very soon. I don't know how well it works, I'm doing server side stuff.

3/26/2015 19:51,3/26/2015 23:51,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts. 

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself. You'll need to recreate this picture later, the one you took is all blurry.

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little. 

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday,looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. You failed to mention that you did look at the Sonar thing and you do intend to fix some of the critical items you saw for the code you're touching. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. Why can't he sleep like this at night? Because the swing isn't on Elissa, that's why. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you. 

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back abut svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attnetion. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps. 

--insert pic--

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Own's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tested. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

--insert pic--

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him. 

--insert pic---

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs. 

---insert pic---

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep. 

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk

--insert pic--

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and hw getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again. 

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard. 

--insert pic--

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably you request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You econnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there! 

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now. 
 
You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair. 

You make breakfast for tomorrow and then try to settle him by putting him in the sling, but that doesn't work, so you nurse him on the couch. He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm. Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read peeka who together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You nurse him to sleep. You sing him the sleepy Owen sing. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do done squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle.",A day in the life 2015,,,,,,

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday,looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. You failed to mention that you did look at the Sonar thing and you do intend to fix some of the critical items you saw for the code you're touching. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. Why can't he sleep like this at night? Because the swing isn't on Elissa, that's why. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you. 

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back abut svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attnetion. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps. 

--insert pic--

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Own's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tested. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

--insert pic--

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him. 

--insert pic---

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs. 

---insert pic---

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep. 

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk

--insert pic--

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and hw getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again. 

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard. 

--insert pic--

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably you request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You econnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there! 

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now. 
 
You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair. 

You make breakfast for tomorrow and then try to settle him by putting him in the sling, but that doesn't work, so you nurse him on the couch. He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm. Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read peeka who together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You nurse him to sleep. You sing him the sleepy Owen sing. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do done squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle. 

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, sparkle across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is spinning with thought, sleep won't come easy, but you soon find your thighs blurring and skipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, cvs sttl asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep. 

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again.",A day in the life 2015,,,,,,
3/27/2015 5:49,3/27/2015 9:49,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts. 

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself. You'll need to recreate this picture later, the one you took is all blurry.

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little. 

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner!

You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs.

He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now. 
 
You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair. 

You make breakfast for tomorrow and then try to settle him by putting him in the sling, but that doesn't work, so you nurse him on the couch. He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm. Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read peeka who together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You nurse him to sleep. You sing him the sleepy Owen sing. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do done squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle. 

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, sparkle across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is spinning with thought, sleep won't come easy, but you soon find your thighs blurring and skipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, cvs sttl asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep. 

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again. Really quickly actually. That was super easy. You read more of the book sample and then quietly back to bed.

Two hours later, you're awoken again. You take him to the mattress and you both fall asleep cuddled together. You wake up  and see Bryan sneaking in. You wake up again at 4 and switch sides and again at 5:30. You can't nurse him back to sleep at that point and you've had enough sleep, so you get up and change his diaper. That was a very good night.",A day in the life 2015,,,,,,
3/27/2015 7:34,3/27/2015 11:34,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts. 

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself. You'll need to recreate this picture later, the one you took is all blurry.

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little. 

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday,looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. You failed to mention that you did look at the Sonar thing and you do intend to fix some of the critical items you saw for the code you're touching. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. Why can't he sleep like this at night? Because the swing isn't on Elissa, that's why. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you. 

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back abut svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attnetion. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps. 

--insert pic--

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Own's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tested. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

--insert pic--

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him. 

--insert pic---

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs. 

---insert pic---

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep. 

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk

--insert pic--

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and hw getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again. 

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard. 

--insert pic--

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably you request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You econnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there! 

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard.

You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. Why can't he sleep like this at night? Because the swing isn't on Elissa, that's why. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you. 

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back abut svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attnetion. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps.

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Own's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tested. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him.

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs. 

---insert pic---


These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep. 

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk

You talk about Owen's poor sleeping habits and hw getting him on a schedule is proving impossible. You talk about exercise and the fun things Bryan will do when it's nice out. Owen's getting drowsy. Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't wan

t to traumatize him with the swing again. 

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard.

Malformed JSON object. OK, probably you request is bad, that's good. You need quotes? No, that's not it. You try nursing squats again... with the baby, not the code. After a bit he finally falls asleep. Carolyn texts, she's ready for her baby to make his appearance. You remind her it can happen any moment. You work while he snoozes. Oh, you see what you're missing. Yay, new error. Making progress now! Success! You check the database for your data. Aaaand Toad's not responding. You econnect, but your data isn't in the table. so, when it said success, it lied. Ah, your data's still bad. You try again. ""invalid identifier"" ??? whyyyyyyyy. But it's there! 

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now. 
 
You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair.

You make breakfast for tomorrow and then try to settle him by putting him in the sling, but that doesn't work, so you nurse him on the couch. He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm. Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read peeka who together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You nurse him to sleep. You sing him the sleepy Owen sing. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do done squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle. 

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, sparkle across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is spinning with thought, sleep won't come easy, but you soon find your thighs blurring and skipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, cvs sttl asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep. 

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again. Really quickly actually. That was super easy. You read more of the book sample and then quietly back to bed.

Two hours later, you're awoken again. You take him to the mattress and you both fall asleep cuddled together. You wake up  and see Bryan sneaking in. You wake up again at 4 and switch sides and again at 5:30. You can't nurse him back to sleep at that point and you've had enough sleep, so you get up and change his diaper. That was a very good night. Owen touches your hair and holds your thumb. You melt a little. ""Mommy loves you.""

3/27/2015 9:56,3/27/2015 13:56,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg""><img class="" alignleft"" title=""20150326_064820.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""241"" height=""428"" /></a>

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts.

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself. You'll need to recreate this picture later, the one you took is all blurry. <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436.jpg""><img class="" size-medium wp-image-4756 alignright"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436-169x300.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_070436.jpg"" width=""169"" height=""300"" /></a>

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little.

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday, looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again.

You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attention. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps.

You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs.

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter. On the way up you hear Bryan comment on Owen's pathetic poop. Not even a 1. Back to testing while you enjoy your apple and Bryan tries to put Owen to sleep.

14:16:52 -0500 (CDT) You think it's really cute that an automated system joins the chat room to tell everyone when there's been a successful build and the new code is automatically being deployed. You think it's even cuter you don't have to manually go and do that. You hear Owen, ""ya, aye, ya ya ya, ya."" Guess he's not asleep yet. ""Waaah, aaaah, aaaaaaaaaah, ayagoo, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!"" Better than hysterical crying. Your build doesn't deploy locally automatically, you do that yourself so you can do more of the tests. Now he's really crying. You suggest a family walk.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-4772"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_153710-e1427463846953-576x1024.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_153710.jpg"" width=""576"" height=""1024"" /></a>

Bryan asks if he should sleep in the swing or on you when you get back. You say he can sleep on you, you don't want to traumatize him with the swing again.

But Owen won't sleep on you. He starts nodding off, but then stares at you a while, pulls off and strikes up a conversation. You let him chill on the floor. He smacks his lips and plays with the pillow. You check your email. You look down at Owen and he smiles. He wants you to pick him up, but he's all hyper. You won't get any work done with that squirmy thing on your lap. Where did your saved http request go? You build it again. You try nursing squats, no luck. You tell him he can do tummy time then. You text Bryan that he won't sleep. Bryan will entertain him while you work. Carolyn texts you. You test your new code, you get an error. Owen's going crazy with his keyboard.

Oy, it's so late for Owen to be napping. He won't sleep tonight. Usually you go to bed at 6:30. It's 5:45 now. You've disturbed the beast. Hes crying. You've made a terrible mistake. He burps and farts, that stops the crying for a minute. You do squats until he calms down. He wants to type. cccccccc`z`````````z, no he wants to eat the keyboard. You bring him downstairs and finish up with work. Bryan changes Owen's diaper, you hear him giggle. OK, yeah, you added the column to the wrong database... you fix that. Hey, it works! OK. Done for the day. You'll figure out the difference between those databases tomorrow. Eats now.

You heat up the rest of the leftover pasta and then some spaghetti squash for angry Owen. You put it in a mesh strainer for him. He loves it. His second serving falls victim to gravity. You pick it up and give it back to him several times. Dessert is gelato. Owen's fussing and angrily throwing everything off his high chair.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg""><img class=""  alignleft"" title=""20150326_182006.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_182006.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""121"" height=""215"" /></a>

He seems hungry, but won't finish eating. The three of you hang out for a bit.

7pm, Bryan gives him a bottle while you get ready for bed. He enthusiastically gobbles it up. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and makes him giggle while you put on your pajamas. You put lotion on Owen and Bryan puts him in his pajamas while you fill your water glasses. You take Owen around the room and say goodnight to all the things. You read Peek-a-Who? together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

You sing him the sleepy Owen song. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do some squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle.

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, spread across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is swimming with thoughts, but you soon find them blurring and slipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, still asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep.

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again. Really quickly actually. That was super easy. You read more of the book sample and then quietly back to bed.

Two hours later, you're awoken again. You take him to the mattress and you both fall asleep cuddled together. You wake up and see Bryan sneaking in. You wake up again at 4 and switch sides and again at 5:30. You can't nurse him back to sleep at that point and you've had enough sleep, so you get up and change his diaper. That was a very good night. Owen touches your hair and holds your thumb. You melt a little. ""Mommy loves you.""

3/27/2015 9:58,3/27/2015 13:58,"6am, you wake up, in your bed, this is good. You got at least 6 hours of real, albeit, interrupted sleep. Win. Owen's still sleeping. You decide to go back to sleep.

6:09, you hear a fart. Maybe he won't wake up. You hear him fussing. Crap. You hear a bigger fart. Poop? You pick up the now crying baby and bring him to the changing table. He protests, real tears and he doesn't smell like poop, you decide to just nurse him back to sleep. You do as you carefully button some of the buttons you already undid. Only 6:30 and he's asleep. You get excited, maybe you can actually exercise this morning. You carefully get up to place him back down to sleep, he opens his eyes. Crap. You sit back down. You try to nurse him again, but it's no use. He strikes up a conversion. Guess it's safe to change that diaper now. No poop. You put in a liner to catch the inevitable poop. You hear him grunting from the bathroom. Poop's coming for sure.<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg""><img class="" alignleft"" title=""20150326_064820.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_064820.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""241"" height=""428"" /></a>

Time for second breakfast. First was at 3:30. He plays gravity in his high chair while you finish your pumpkin raisin overnight oats and drink your tea that's been sitting out since first breakfast. You think about what to do with him. You decide he's not going back to sleep right now. Maybe you can exercise. You take him upstairs and put on your workout clothes and contacts.

You grab a blanket and some toys for when the bouncer becomes boring. You place him in it and the blanket on the floor. You usually watch six feet under, but due to present company, decide Voyager is the better choice today. You complete 20 minutes on the elliptical while Owen amuses himself.Â  <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436.jpg""><img class="" size-medium wp-image-4756 alignright"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_070436-169x300.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_070436.jpg"" width=""169"" height=""300"" /></a>

He gets cranky, so you transfer him to the blanket and he's happy again. You finish up another ten minutes or so, incorporating Owen tickles into your stretches. OMG those giggles. OMG, those two little teeth. You die of cuteness a little.

He's had enough and oh, he stinks. You ask him if he's made a poop. You turn off the tv and bring him upstairs. He did make a poop, maybe a 2 or 3 on the poop scale, all on the liner! You start cleaning him off when you hear the trickle of water. Shit. You look over, he's wet. He pees some more. Oy. You grab a smaller diaper to absorb the pee and wipe away the poo he just managed to get on his foot. You take off his wet clothes and give him a once over with a wipe. You put on a new diaper and liner because you know that's not the end of the poop. You place him in his crib while you clean up.

He fusses while you're picking out new clothes. Good, maybe he'll go back to sleep. You dress him in a short sleeve Apple onesie since its supposed to be warm today, put on pants and his booties. You sit to nurse him back to sleep and he grabs your boob and shoves it in his mouth. He eats and then falls asleep, yay, but he wants to keep your boob, boo. That will make it super hard to shower. You browse Facebook on your phone some more. You manage to get him to drop the nipple. You wait about ten minutes to make sure he's really asleep before trying to get up. His eyes open. Crap. You put him in the swing and turn it on. Bryan stirs. Owen whimpers, but you don't really have a choice. You hear him yell as you leave the bedroom.

You shower, decide you really need to shave today. You forgot to bring up your new body wash ... again. You use the scented stuff instead. You dry off, put lotion on your face and legs. Baby's quiet, but you don't dare peek in and disturb the peace. You grab your laptop from downstairs and log into work. Only running twenty minutes behind today. You have a text from your mom about Andrew dogsitting for them.

9am, you join your daily standup call with your new team while you jump on the trampoline. You got switched from Pulp Fiction to Die Hard Monday because your old team didn't have any work. Just as you were getting comfortable with everyone and actually contributing. Now you have to learn all new code with all new people. It sucks. You hate these calls. You feel anxious while you wait to be called on, keeping track of the folks who have already gone. You tell that you worked on your user story yesterday, looked through some of the other code and will do the same today. You call on Raj to go next. You get dressed while you listen to the other statuses. The call ended. The baby's still quiet, that's a first. Maybe you should check to make sure he's OK... Bryan's in there, you're sure they're fine. Best not to disturb. You go downstairs to grab a snack, apple and almond butter, but decide to heat up some leftover cajun pasta instead. Who knows when you'll get another chance to eat. You put your body wash in your pocket so you don't forget to bring it upstairs. You put away clean pump parts and start cleaning the dirty ones while it's in the microwave. You bring the food upstairs and then start your codin'.

You actually have a super simple user story to add a new field to the server-side code. You could probably finish it in a day, but you spent hours yesterday debating whether the values you should store in the database should be 0 and 1 or N and Y or F and T. You must have looked through all the code trying to find a precedent, you didn't. You really made all the changes yesterday and now you have to test it, but that's the harder part. You hear Owen ""ooh."" He probably pooped. You'll let Bryan handle that.

What the hell, not applicable for the arguments, yes it is! What's Eclipse talking about? You delete the line of code and put it back and now it's happy. The frell. It's quiet again. Maybe he went back to sleep. Wow. One of the contractors who was off when you started, Q's you. He's in India, he says good morning. Folks in India always say good morning when it's night there, always. You're never sure if you should say it back, you do anyway. He welcomes you to the team. You thank him and return to your code. He asks you how things are going. You say, ""So far so good :)"" And realize that's the third smiley face you've used. Ugh. He's letting you know he'll be working on the same part of the code. You tell him you're ready to commit some changes and start testing, so you'll do that. You try and it won't let you. You Q someone else for help getting permissions to commit. You hate being new.

You decide to check on the baby since you have a meeting at 10:30. He's asleep alright. Hopefully he sleeps through the meeting, though you can probably feed him during. This test is failing. Maybe you're connected to the wrong database? Oh, it sets up a little test database. That's cute. You add your new field there. Didn't work, where's your new field? You're hungry again. You hear the baby. You go wake Bryan up. they're both awake. Owen smiles at you. You give him an update on Owen's morning so far. You're both shocked he went back to sleep because really, THAT NEVER HAPPENS. He asked if he had a bad night. Yeah, he did go to bed late and thrashed around when he was sleeping next to you.

You chat with Bryan while they're in the other room, doing the diaper thing. He says he loves him so much. No poop. Nathan Q's back about svn while you're joining your next meeting. Never good when the client apologies ""for what's about to rain down on you."" You nurse Owen while you listen. He's distracted. You take him and the phone in the other room to grab your new nursing necklace. He wants to chew on the necklace instead of nursing. He lunges for your phone. You latch him on the other side. Oh right,you're supposed to make the sign for milk. He's not paying attention. Owe, let go mama's hair. He's so squirmy. The commit's working now. You were using the wrong folder. You won't admit to that. Bryan comes up and says he'll take a shower and to put Owen in the crib when he's done. He'll never be done, he's taking forever. He lunges for the nail clippers. No no no no no. You pry them out of his hands. He's chewing your fist now. Not the fitbit baby. Ew, it's all slimey. He burps.

He's so squirmy, you smell him. Smells like poop. Jason Q's you and asks how it's going. You hate being new. You commit your code. Owen's squirming and pulling on your face. You put him down on the quilt on the floor. He wrestles with the pink pillow. You hear the shower turn off, he can wait for his diaper until Bryan gets back. You give him the puppy to play with. Then the keyboard. You tell Bryan you think he pooped. He did poop! Gah, you broke the build. Stupid automated tests. Bryan takes Owen out. And now your local's broken. Same issue you were having Monday. You check in everything and delete the project and start over again. Bryan texts you a picture of Owen, you assume at the mall.

You undid your change while you figure out where you messed up. You see Bryan's car outside, Owen must have fallen asleep on the way home. Reena Q's you, she's still having env issues too :( Reena's getting an out of memory error??? But you fixed that! Oh good, she doesn't have your changes, that's a relief. How is it 1:00??? She asks if you changed a file, you didn't. Eclipse is being mean. You go downstairs and heat up second lunch and wash the rest of the pump parts. Bryan texts you that Owen seems to be taking his long nap in the car. OK, you deleted the class, where can it possibly be picking up your changes from??? Now it's picking them up aaaaaand now it's not. WTF. Baby's awake, Bryan's changing him.

Nursing time. He's very hungry. No, he's very distracted. Now he's eating OK. You browse facebook while he chows down. You check the weather. Owen farts. More poop? He grabs your nose and digs his nails in. Ouch! Bryan comes up. You chat and try feeding him some more. You tell him you hope the weather clears up a little so you can go for a walk later. He pulls your hair, you tell him no, play with the necklace. Bryan says he should be really hungry. You suggest avocado or sweet potato from the freezer. He chews on your necklace. You tell Owen if he isn't going to eat more, you're sending him away so you can work. He chews on your n=finger. Bryan takes him downstairs.

These build emails are getting out of hand. You create a rule to filter them. You hear Bryan talking to... Rae and Lyra? Bryan brings his iPod up so you can say hi and he scoots out again. Doh, you know what's wrong with the code, forgot a darn question mark! OK, build should be squared away now. And Venkata of course is off now because it's sleeping time in India, so that's good. So I guess that means time for more testing. Or a walk. Did it stop raining? It's not pleasant out. Bryan thinks Owen needs a nap. You decide now is a good time for that apple and almond butter.

You read Peek-a-Who? together and then the beginning of another book until Owen starts fussing.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_191839-e1427464264135.jpg""><img class="" size-medium wp-image-4764 alignleft"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/wpid-20150326_191839-e1427464264135-169x300.jpg"" alt=""wpid-20150326_191839.jpg"" width=""169"" height=""300"" /></a>You nurse him to sleep. You sing him the sleepy Owen song. He wakes up crying every time he gets some milk. You try to burp him, but he claws at your face. You do some squats and back to nursing again. He's finally snoozing. You read the book sample you downloaded on your kindle.

8pm, He unlatches. He's pretty asleep. This could be it. He flips onto his back, spread across your lap. You wait a beat and then carefully get up. The fan in the bedroom is off, doh, you carefully turn it on. Wow he's asleep. You carefully place him in the swing. Yes, still asleep. You cover him with a blanket and slip away to use the bathroom and then climb into bed yourself. Your head is swimming with thoughts, but you soon find them blurring and slipping away. You hear Owen move. You look over, still asleep. You relax again, check him one more time and relax again. You feel yourself slip off to sleep.

He's crying! What time is it? 11, wow, you can't remember the last time he had that long a stretch at night. You really don't want to get up, but you grab him and sit on the mattress on the floor. He quiets as soon as your boob is in his mouth. You lie down. He's pretty squirmy and eventually pulls off and won't nurse anymore. You get up, he's screaming. You do a couple squats in the hall, he stops as Bryan gets there. He starts up again and Bryan starts changing his diaper. You go to the bathroom. He almost pees on Bryan, but he catches the stream with the new diaper. He's happy, that's usually not a good sign. He gives him back to you to nurse and he grins at Bryan. You try to nurse him, but he keeps looking for daddy. Eventually he focuses on the task at hand and falls asleep once again. Really quickly actually. That was super easy. You read more of the book sample and then quietly back to bed.

Two hours later, you're awoken again. You take him to the mattress and you both fall asleep cuddled together. You wake up and see Bryan sneaking in. You wake up again at 4 and switch sides and again at 5:30. You can't nurse him back to sleep at that point and you've had enough sleep, so you get up and change his diaper. That was a very good night. Owen touches your hair and holds your thumb. You melt a little. ""Mommy loves you.""

I didn't know how much he would like walks or how magical his giggles would sound. I didn't know rolling a ball on the floor or making funny faces could be so entertaining. 
I didn't know watching him learn and grow would be the most fascinating and exciting part of my life. I didn't know cuddling with him would be so cozy. I didn't know I'd rather be here, nursing and rocking him to sleep, than any other place in the world.
I had no idea I would love him this much and how much I'd want another one :D
I knew our moms would make the best grandmas though. Owen loves his Grammy, Grandma and Great Nana so much. Happy Mother's day!

5/30/2015 13:08,5/30/2015 17:08,"I'm confused because I thought I had already written and published this post. Well, what I said was that he's gotten much better at tummy time. He's trying very hard to crawl. Or maybe he's trying to walk by going from his tummy to standing, it's hard to tell. He can pull himself to standing very well and he can even get back down again gracefully.

He climbs all over me. He's always pulled my hair, but it's gotten worse now that he can always get to it. He also has some interesting nursing positions. Last night he fell asleep with his butt in the air. Sleep is still the same.

He loves to jump. He likes to stand and jump in his crib. Ironically, he's not all that fond of his exersaucer/jumper, but he likes it more than he used to.

His eyes still haven't turned brown. He might actually have hazel eyes. We'll see.

He can feed himself a bit, but eats much better from a spoon. Peaches seem to be his favorite, but he's also fond of pears, blueberries and mango. He had a lot of fun with the spaghetti squash.

Chris, Rae and Lyra are visiting. More adorable baby pictures to come. So much fun playing with these two little ones.

I took some time off work this week. Went shopping, spent too much on shoes. I also got my first <a href=""https://www.stitchfix.com/referral/3039521"">stitchfix </a>this month. I ended up keeping a skirt and a shirt they sent. More than anything it was fun and it's good for me to buy some adult clothing. Don't worry, I balanced it out by buying unicorn leggings from Kohls.

6/3/2015 7:04,6/3/2015 11:04,"So, I'm turning <del>30</del> 29 again on Friday. As many of you know, Back to the Future has been my favorite movie since forever so I' used to think a lot about what my life would be like in 2015. 30 seemed so so so far away. I don't think life is too far off from where I thought I would be. I certainly don't look or feel as old as I thought I would, yay.

My 20s started out pretty terrible. <a href=""http://silvercpu.com/?p=1060"">I had an awful stomach thing</a>, looking back it was probably an ulcer. I really should have gone to the doctor. I had just finished a very lonely semester at school because Rachelle transferred, and I was dealing with that stalker guy who did turn out to be harmless, but I really shouldn't have talked to him in the first place :-/

I briefly dated Adi and then I was back to being alone again, though at least Carolyn was at Rutgers, which helped.Â  One night, I was feeling particularly depressed and couldn't sleep.Â  I logged into Facebook and saw this:
<blockquote><span class=""null"">I work at the Busch Convenience Store, and the other night I was in charge of the store for the night and I happened to be on register when you checked out. I know I've seen you in there a lot, and every time I see you I think you're really really really attractive. As soon as I was done with that transaction I went to have my dinner, and we have a computer in the back. So I just thought I'd look you up on facebook, since I couldn't help but remember your name flashing up as ""Elissa""... It's a really cool name, and not that common so it stuck in my head.</span></blockquote>
Though getting him to ask me out was pretty difficult, so I finally asked him over t watch Rent and we've been together ever since.

Senior year of college was better socially with Bryan, Emily and Helen around, but my classes were really tough and I nearly had a nervous breakdown a few times. I had planned to go to graduate school, but I couldn't take anymore, so I shifted my focus and looked for a job instead of a summer internship.

I had two offers in March. One place up by my parents and AT&amp;T down here. It wasn't a hard decision. Even at the interview I felt like I fit in there. I manged to make it out of school alive and with straight As, CS degree, highest honors. I also stopped wearing my retainer apparently. I still have nightmares about that thing.

I moved into the apartment with Bryan and started working. Our first project at att was DBOR test support which pretty much involved us getting yelled at on conference calls for things we had no control over. Then I started doing real development on NCD and finally RUBY. I started really getting into fitness and exercising every day due to my desk job and the cake that came with it.

Bryan and I went on our first trip to Disney together where he proposedÂ  on the balcony of our hotel room. On my first real project on RUBY, NFM, I remember meeting with Roy and he wanted me to look at the code while I was on vacation. I told him I'd be busy looking at wedding dresses. I looked at a lot of dresses.

2009 was mostly spent wedding planning. We also went for our first round of CP training in CT and TX. In January 2010, Bryan and I got married and of course went to Disney on our honeymoon. We actually went twice that year. We also couldn't take the tiny apartment anymore and bought a house. We probably could have gotten a better deal if we waited a year, but this place has worked out nicely. Once we fixed theÂ  deadly bathtub and other DIY improvements the previous owners made.

I finally made my community theater debut as Little Miss Muffet in Babes in Toyland. I think I was shaking the first ten minutes of every show. Despite performing and joining Toast Masters, my social anxiety still gets the best of me most of the time.

At work I took over as the lead of the One Team, our social planning committee and held that position for over 2 years before passing it off. That was a lot of work, but at least I got a nice bonus that first year.

I went to Rome with my parents and ate a lot of gelato, got lost frequently, took a cooking class. Our tour of the Vatican was pretty incredible and it was nice to see Melanie in Naples.

2012 I traveled to Florida twice for CP training and once for Disney. That was also the year of Hurricane Sandy where we lost power for nine days and lived like Nomads. Carolyn and Rachelle both got married that fall. Helen and Darian's wedding was the following year along with our trip to San Fransisco to visit Chris and Rae.

Of course the best year of my twenties was this past year. Lyra was born early, but strong. Being pregnant with Owen was quite an experience and giving birth of course, life with a newborn. Those first few months were rough, but things are pretty great now. I hope life continues it's upwards trend.

Over the next decade, I hope to have another baby, you know, once this one is potty trained. I had wanted a girl, but I can see us with another boy too, plus I actually have another boy name I like and I'm no longer crazy about our girl name. I also want to finally get a dog, but don't know if it'll be between kids or after the second one.

I don't plan to ever leave att. It's so nice being able to work from home and play with Owen during breaks. Plus it's close by, not too stressful, interesting projects. I don't know how I feel about this SDN stuff yet, but there are always other projects.

I'd like to do another show at some point, probably not at least until Owen's old enough to be in one. And by then we'll have another one, so who knows.

I don't have too many goals left to fulfill. Just to spend as much time with family as possible. Can't wait to take that first trip with Owen to Disney.

6/29/2015 6:34,6/29/2015 10:34,"And loving life. Not so much sleeping. Just when you thought sleep couldn't get any worse, enter the nine month sleep regression. Is it teething, is it gas, who knows? Then there's the times he wants to play, though that's gotten a bit better. At least he doesn't wake up wanting to play these days.

He is a mobile little dude. Probably the standing and the crawling has interfered with his sleep too. He gets into all sorts of trouble. We've mostly baby proofed... we watch him. He's really into shoes. First thing he goes for. He likes shoes, walks, he bites, he drools, he eats food off the floor, he barks in his sleep, I think this kid was a dog in a previous life.

We had a lot of excitement this month. Cheryl and Yori's wedding, a day trip down the shore. He had a lot of fun dancing at the wedding and trying to eat my food. They had some good food. They did part potluck. I had a kiwi artichoke cupcake for dessert. It was amazing.

He had fun playing with his cousin down the shore. He was too hot on the boardwalk. Didn't care for the merry-go-round much. Spinning around in a circle is good, but doing it on an actual ride... We're just happy he slept in the car. I was on the edge of my seat the entire trip waiting for him to wake up. And he did, going down, damn toll booth guy, but he slept the whole way back.

He's not too into food, but he'll pretty much eat anything if he gets to feed himself. More ends up on is clothes than in his mouth, but he tries. I've been trying out baby recipes, but so far I've been eating more of the stuff than he has.

His sixth tooth is almost through. Those top four teeth sure do take their time punching through. He's constantly rubbing his face, I think because his gums itch. Going to ask the doctor when he goes Tuesday. Last night he gave himself two scratches. I felt awful.

He is a mobile little dude. Probably the standing and the crawling has interfered with his sleep too. He gets into all sorts of trouble. We've mostly baby proofed... we watch him.

We had a lot of excitement this month. Cheryl and Yori's wedding, a day trip down the shore. He had a lot of fun dancing at the wedding and trying to eat my food. They had some good food. They did part potluck. I had a kiwi artichoke cupcake for dessert. It was amazing.

He had fun playing with his cousin down the shore. He was too hot on the boardwalk. Didn't care for the merry-go-round much. Spinning around in a circle is good, but doing it on an actual ride...

7/25/2015 6:07,7/25/2015 10:07,"He's going to be a toddler before I know it. He's been getting into all kinds of trouble this month. He's up the stairs in a flash every chance he gets, climbing into the dishwasher, getting into drawers. Yesterday he was standing on the bench chewing on the top of his pack n play and doing pull-ups on the baby gate.

His sleep is steadily getting a little better. He flips onto his tummy now when he's done eating and sometimes does two hour stretches. 

Carolyn texted me Connor's bedtime routine: bath, book, boob, bed. This was my response:
We do bath, diaper, jump on the bed, say goodnight to all the things, try to read book, boob, book, boob, book, boob, bed, cry, boob, crawl all over mommy, cry, boob, crawl, cry, boob, roll over onto tummy, cry, boob, roll onto tummy, repeat x 10, sleep

He's had a couple of play dates with his new buddy, Nolan, who lives in the next set of houses over. Super convenient.

Had a girls brunch earlier this month. Was nice to get out and see my friends. Carolyn and Connor came over yesterday. The looks Connor gave Owen were priceless. The funny thing is he's six months younger, but they're nearly the same size. Big little dude, and so cute!",Ten Months,,,,,,

8/4/2015 10:49,8/4/2015 14:49,"I've probably written this post before, but I felt the urge to gush. I am so lucky. Granted I picked a really good field to go into, but still, I have THE best job. You know you have good work/life balance when you look forward to going into the office in the morning and look forward to coming home in the evening.

Of course, the number one thing is I get to work from home three days a week and spend more time with my Owen &lt;3

Being able to pump in my office is also a big help as I need to pump four times a day and that would be quite a pain to be going off to some room somewhere that often.

Flex hours. No one really cares when I start/end as long it more or less 8 hours a day, 40 hours a week.

The people. I don't have anything bad to say about anyone that works here. They're great people and I really enjoy working with them. I've said it before, but this is really the first place I've ever felt like I fit in.

The work, OK, it's not that interesting or challenging, but it's interesting enough and challenging enough for where I am in life (and that's spending every ounce of free time with the baby). I also really enjoy things like our yearly hackathon (that we didn't win again, but still, it was a lot of fun).

Training. They give us plenty of time and plenty of courses so we're never falling too far behind.

Discounts. We get 50% off our cell service and now we get free TV! Bryan and I are so excited, ha ha. Not that we have time to watch TV, but the option will be there.

Oh yeah, it pays the bills. Really, they pay me to do this? OK, so I wouldn't do it for free, or probably even less than I get since I'm the only one working, but we're blissfully comfortable and that's awesome.

Sure things get stressful once in a while and I spend all day working on a problem only to realize I was writing ""get"" instead of ""post,"" and our health insurance is meh, but I love this place.

8/30/2015 8:35,8/30/2015 12:35,"We're already planning the next Disney trip and it over a year away. This will be trip #20 for me and trip #1 for Owen &lt;3 We're just so excited to take him. I wonder what he'll be like a year from now.

For now, he's intent on walking. That's his new favorite thing. He'll cruise around the living room using his walker, or the rolling stool or a table or a container. Anything can be a walker. His current record is five steps unassisted.

Bryan texted me other other day; ""Purse is to bathtub as mouse is to trampoline"" and I knew exactly what he meant. Owen loves his purse. Owen loves bringing his purse into his (dry) bathtub. Owen also loves my mouse and chewing on it while sitting on my trampoline. Can't make this stuff up.

He still loves kiwis and Ive been mixing oatmeal into his smoothies which apparently make them even more appealing. Otherwise he eats a lot of what we do. And he's be eating a lot lately. Running in circles and jumping on his bed must burn a lot of calories. He's looking too skinny to me, but I don't know how to get more food into this kid's stomach. He still eats in his sleep at night.

His sleep has been much better though. Usually two hour stretches now. He even had a five hour stretch the other night :O

His new favorite word (next to ""mama"") is ""uh-oh."" He woke up the other night and said ""uh-oh"" instead of crying :D

He's been hitting all of his milestones until now. He doesn't wave, clap or point. It responds when we do these things, but looks at us with a completely blank expression when we ask him to do them. He does give high fives. I don't think it means anything, because he's otherwise social and communicates well, but you can't help but worry a little.

For now, he's intent on walking. That's his new favorite thing. He'll cruise around the living room using his walker, or the rolling stool or a table or a container. Anything can be a walker.

Bryan texted me other other day; ""Purse is to bathtub as mouse is to trampoline"" and I knew exactly what he meant. Owen loves his purse. Owen loves bring his purse into his (dry) bathtub. Owen also loves my mouse and chewing on it while sitting on my trampoline. Can't make this stuff up.

He still loves kiwis and Ive been mixing oatmeal into his smoothies which apparently make them even more appealing. Otherwise he eats a lot of what we do. And he's be eating a lot lately. Running in circles an jumping on his bed must burn a lot of calories. He's looking too skinny to me, but I don't know how to get more food into this kid's stomach. He still eats in his sleep at night.

He's been hitting all of his milestones until now. He doesn't wave, clap or point. It responds when we do these things, but looks at us with a completely blank expression when we ask him to do them.",Ten Months,,,,,,

His sleep has been much better though. Usually two hour stretches now. He even had a five hour stretch the other night :O

Owen is 13 months today. He had such a great time at his birthday parties &lt;3 And then he got sick :( He had blisters all over his throat and wouldn't eat anything but mommy milk for two week. So glad I'm still nursing. He's back to normal now, but has developed an aversion toÂ  some foods he previously loved.

Then I got sick. And I'm still coughing and my ear is still stuffy and my throat still hurts. I think it's that allergies hit at the same time. I really need to clean everything. Our house is a disaster and I'm sure that's not helping.

Gymboree today! Yay! I think that's my favorite part of the week. Watching Owen run around and have such a good time is the best.

Night weaning has to happen though. Really. Probably when I'm off in December.

He's learning so much every day. He's gotten so good at saying ""geese"" and running to the window to look for them. He recently learned to point to his head and put his shapes in the right spots in his house and he does it with the biggest smile because he's so proud of himself &lt;3 So much fun just watching him.

He's been eating a lot lately, so we're thinking growth spurt. He can reach so many things he's not supposed to! Ha ha. Looking forward to when his feet reach the ground when he sits on his pirate ship. Maybe he can push himself a little and save our backs!

We went to Brian's last week and he had so much fun running around in a field by his house. Not fun on the drive home. He screamed for 30 minutes straight and made himself throw up. :(

He loves gymboree. I need to get a video of him when his teacher brings out the busy box. It's like Christmas.

Since I haven't written a post this month...
It's been an unusually warm December which has been great for walks. We even took several evening walks around the neighborhood to look at all the lights. I took of the last two weeks of the month and Owen and I have been having a great time together. It was raining the other day and the three of us checked out the new indoor playground just down the street. This kid has unlimited energy.
Christmas was a lot of fun. He loves socializing with everyone. He's definitely still happiest when we haveÂ company. He's the life of the party! Food was good too. Even Owen ate my kale!
I've been working on night weaning him. Going with Jay Gordon's method, but going a little slower between the first two steps to stretch out the time between feedings instead of cutting them out completely. He's been eating a lot at night, so I don't want to move too fast. So far, so good. The first night was a little rough, I caved in and nursed him really fast, but since then, he's settled with minimal comforting and fallen back asleep. On my chest or my head, but I'll take it.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae's birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I've read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn't have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian's and my parents'. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian';s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She's a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&amp;'s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I've been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I've been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I've been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I'm making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn't have a mortgage then. As long as we don't go crazy buying shit we don't need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the New Black and Downton Abbey.
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.

2014-2015
Let's see this year I found out I was pregnant, announced I was pregnant, had many baby showers, gave birth, hung out with the cutest little guy ever for three months. We also went to Disney and I did much training at work in preparation for changing assignments.
This year I watched an awful lot of Star Trek. Bryan and I watched all of DS9 together, then when Owen was born we watched all of TNG and we're currently going through Voyager. They hold up better than I thought they would. TNG is best overall, DS9 has the best story arc and Voyager is the funniest.
Today was my first day back in the office. I was too preoccupied with pumping to get much done, but I don't have any real work to do anyway and no one was there to give me anything to do. I showed Maryam the training project I made up. I wish I were more creative and could think of something better than a quiz app to make.
Tonight I will probably go to sleep early since I've been up at 2:30am. Not Owen's fault, he slept 7 hours last night and then another 4 1/2. He had us cracking up during his feeding, and then he has no idea why we're laughing, so he just looks at us like we're crazy and then smiles nervously which of course makes us laugh more. Love him.

2015-2016
I spent this past year having the time of my life with my little guy. I look forward to each day wondering what new thing he's going to discover. He loves life and learning about the world. He loves being silly and he loves his family so much. I've had off the last couple weeks and we've had a blast! I really don't want to go back to work.
Last night we left OwenÂ with Bryan's parents while we went to see the new Star Wars. He had a great time and so did we. The movie wasÂ really good. I'm glad we decided to go see it, especially since Owen was fine with his grandparents. He asked about us once and that was all.
In the process of night weaning. Last night went pretty well. He didn't nurse until 1am and I limited him to two minutes. Then he had a twelve course meal at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep :-/ It's 7am now and he's finally resting soundly, but I guess I'm not getting any more sleep this morning. At least I got my workout in.
I guess I usually write about shows I've been watching, ha ha. With our new free DirectTV I've gotten all caught up on the Walking Dead and some of Girl Meets World. Been re-watching Gilmore Girls and it freaks me out a little that I now have more in common with the mom rather than the daughter.
Today, I'm not sure what we're doing, but we always have a good time.",New Years Past,,,,,,

This year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license! OKâ¦ almost 12 nowâ¦ talk to ya in 2002â¦ ooh neat, itâs the same forward and backward.
K, itâs 2002 now!! Itâs been a very interesting night. My parents were late for the party, yeah, I was here before them. And Rachel beat me at Mario Party (though I beat her later on Now sheâs serving me (pretend) ice cream and Ethan just gave me a plastic egg, make that two, lol.

2002-2003:
Itâs almost 2003, the year I graduate. Eepers. Well letâs see, this year, Big Brother: Lisa won (but we all wish it was Jason), I got into Rutgers, AP Calc and AP Physics, way scaryâ¦ last yearâs res: âThis year I wanna keep gettin straight As and I wanna get my license!â : ) for both. Well, almost straight As anyway, minus an 89 in AP Physicsâ¦ I had a cold for the first testâ¦ grrâ¦ this year: Try to keep dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch (donât be a geek), donât fall victom to Senioritis, ermâ¦ think thatâs itâ¦ see ya next year!

Well, Happy New Year everyone! Mesa had lotsa fun at party last nightâ¦ âTwas me, Kristin, Cara, and Rachelle. We watched video from the Halloween party and Andrew running into the poleâ¦ twice, lmao, then Austin Powers in Goldmember, Jeckyll and Hyde, Back to the Future!! and begining of The Others. We ate lots, too much, but me hungry, well itâs 12:30 already. So much to do today, wish I didnât have to go back to school tomorrow, ugg, oh wellâ¦

2003-2004:
An hour and a half until Krissyâs party and 8 hours until 2004. This year, I graduated HS, sang at Lincoln center, finished my first semester of college with almost straight Asâ¦ Big Brother stunk, I canât even remember who won, lol. Stupid X-Factor. Last year I said I would keep my dorm room clean, actually go out for lunch, and not fall victom to senioritis. Kept them all : ) This year: I want to loose more weight, keep my room at home as organized as it is now, finish my Evil Squirrel script and do something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦

2004-2005:
Letâs see, what happened this yearâ¦ I met Ben Browderâ¦ I skinned my siteâ¦ got through data structures with minimal damage to my GPA. Last year was much more impressiveâ¦
Last yearâs resolutionâs: âI want to loose more weight,â ok, did that; âkeep my room at home as organized as it is now,â â¦ close enough; âfinish my Evil Squirrel script,â again, close enough; and âdo something worth blogging about. My life is far too dullâ¦â well, my life is still as dull as it was. Oh well. I went to the farscape con, does that count? No? Oh well.
This year I shall make a new friend at school and try my best to drag myself to the dining hall twice a day no matter how cold it is! No soup for Lissy! And maybe practice driving at some point.

2005-2006:
We got back from Disney yesterday. Went with Rachi and Carolyn. Was a lot of fun. Iâm sad to see â05 go. Was a good, exciting year. First boyfriend, first kiss, first 4.0 semester average. This past semester really was great. Perfect schedule, easy classes. What else happened this yearâ¦ got my new tooth, MySpace, prolog is the root of all evil, ooooh Alias finale, Lost, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants adventure, met Tom and Adi (+Fudge), Seasonale is a God send, and a great New Years party at Krissyâs where I wore my spiffy new outfit! âSo take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like youâve never been hurt because every sixty seconds you spend upset is a minute of happiness youâll never get back.â Right now Iâm cleaning up my room listening to my new âThe Happiest Celebration on Earthâ CD : D Me &lt;3 Disney (+ the magic marshmallow smores.) Oh ya, new years res: get a job.

2006-2007:
This year I met Bryan &lt;3 And Will didnât win on Big Brother, Mike did this time. Got straight As again this semester. I finally stopped wearing my retainer. I didnât get a job, not one that paid money anyway, but I do plan to this year. Got drunk for the first time last night too. Thatâs not gonna happen again anytime soon. This journal also turned 10 years old. On Passions, Chad is having an affair with a dude, I hope anyway and Theresa is gonna marry Ethan which is driving him crazy (?). Sheridan turned into a bitch and Paloma and Noah are too cute together!
Well this was probably the worst New Yearâs ever. Apparently alcohol does not agree with me at all. I spent most of my time at the party trying not to throw up. Judez had some good desserts too and I didnât get to have any : ( âLeast I donât feel crappy today.
Then I spent this morning crying after getting yelled at since no one bothered to tell me Shawn was spending the day here. We were supposed to go visit my grandpa today. Theyâre frelling lucky we didnât. My dadâs still very angry though.

2007-2008:
This year I graduated college, with highest honors in CS. I moved in with Bryan and I started work at AT&amp;T. I was doing DBOR test support, going to start programming soon. And my iPod &lt;3 Life is good. Working is so much better than school. And living with Bryan is great. Going to Carolynâs in a bit for the party. Lost season finale was good. Passions moved to DirectTV. House, Pushing Daisies, Gossip Girl and Heroes are my favs. I hope â08 is as good as this year was.
The party was at Carolynâs this year. Rachi couldnât come, but we still managed to have fun. We ate waaaaay too much food and danced and took many pictures. There was some drama when one of the guests showed up with a bunch of other people, but they all left.

2008-2009:
Iâm engaged! Bryan proposed in Disney which was an amazing trip btw. Work is great. We have way too much fun. NCD was a great experience and RUBY is OK too. Iâm a real programmer now! Wedding planning has been fun so far. CP09 training sucks. I guess the two things even out. We got new phones yesterday. Next year Iâll be rolling my eyes at myself for writing that.
I went to Carolynâs for New Yearâs Eve. I drank a lot, but it made it more fun. I ate waaaay too much because Carolyn kept complaining that no one was eating the food and there was a lot of food and I really like eating. We talked a lot about the wedding. I like talking about the wedding, and Iâm glad people are excited about it, but I donât want people to like get sick of me talking about it, lol. It will eventually get annoying, Iâm sure.

2009-2010:
Last year I complained about CP09. Yeah, it sucked, and I couldnât take vacation this year, but I got free trips to CT and TX, both of which were awesome! And I still love my job, even more than last year because now I actually know what Iâm doing. The wedding is only days away. Things are getting pretty crazy. Got my underarms waxed for the first time yesterday, lol. Bryanâs dad and stepmom came over yesterday, brought wine and puppies, both of which I enjoyed too much :P We have no plans tonight! Yup, first time ever since I was about 7? Iâm not even staying up until midnight because I donât want to screw up my sleep schedule before the wedding, but I told Bryan to wake me up to give me my first ever New Yearâs kiss :D

2010-2011:
We got married, we bought a house! For the first time Iâm blogging in âWeâsâ. Went to Disney twice. But we had to put Princess to sleep which was awful. Buffyâs doing better now, though she doesnât hear very well. They just repealed Donât Ask Donât Tell. My job is still getting better and I am getting fatter. The Lost finale was terrible, but Iâm thoroughly enjoying catching up on new and old shows with our DVR. Yay Glee! We liked The Defenders too, but it looks like thatâs getting canceled.
Last night I couldnât sleep and then my alarm, which I made sure I turned off, went off at 7:30. I donât feel crazy tired yet, but Iâm sure I will by 10:00. Yori and Cherylâs party starts at 6 and we have been told there will be legos. Today I plan to clean, exercise and then possibly take a nap.

2011-2012
We went to Colorado. I went with my parents to Rome. It snowed ... a lot. Rachi and Carolyn both got engaged. Buffy lost weight which seems to have helped her arthritis. I started exercising in the morning instead of at night, which made my life to much easier and freed up my time for things like cooking and Babes in Toyland. I went into the city more times this year I think than any other. Rae's birthday, with Cory and the girls, to visit Akua, karaoke.
I got to build web apps for the iPad which I've read is the IT job of 2012. The best part of my job is still definitely the people I work with though. Iâm leader of the One Team now which is turning out to be a lot of work.
I totally love Revenge and I just started watching Doctor Who which is almost, almost as amazing as Farscape. Having Netflix in the exercise room is awesome, though my leg has been killing me from overusing it. Iâve been trying to rest it while at my parentsâ these last few days. I really hope itâs better before Disney.
Wednesday was great. We went shopping for bridesmaid dresses for Carolynâs wedding. We went into the store, found the one Ellen picked out right away, found all of our sizes, tried it on, looked great on everyone, we all liked the same color and we were done. So much easier than any of us could have predicted. We never get to hang out all together like that anymore.
Thursday I went shopping with Rachi and found a really pretty, long dress for her wedding. Then I threw up the Chinese food I ate for breakfast (bad idea).
Yesterday my parents and I went to see the Adams Family on Broadway. I enjoyed dinner much more than the show. The music was terrible, but the spaghetti squash served with my duck was really good.
Going to Yoriâs party tonight. Gotta cook something later. No time for ice cream, but Iâm sure Iâll come up with something yummy.

2012-2013
Went to Florida three times. One trip was Disney, of course, and two for CP12. CP12 was pretty awesome. Got to hang out with Maryam and Julia and they only drove me crazy a little. Our instructors were very entertaining and I learned that I learn best in my sleep. I pretty much have the best job in the world. I got a big bonus, a promotion and the week of the hurricane off paid.
The hurricane was crazy. We didn't have power for 9 days. We went the time at Brian's and my parents'. Of course the hurricane ruined Halloween.
Brian';s daughter is probably one of the cutest kids on the planet. We got her a dino racer for her birthday. She's a fan.
The highlight of the year was definitely Carolyn and Rachelle&amp;'s weddings. They were so much fun I was depressed when they were over. The pre-wedding showers and bachelorette party were pretty great too.
Doctor Who keeps getting better. Bryan and I finished all of Battlestar Galatica which is also amazing. I've been watching way too much Dexter than what could be considered healthy. Gossip Girl had a very satisfying series finale. I've been reliving the 90s by re-watching Felicity and now understanding things better because I've been through college and I know JJ Abrams a little better. Why do I always write so much about TV? I swear I have friends I see on a regular basis. Carolyn and Tom were over Thursday, we played Scrabble.
We have no plans for New Years. We could do something fancy, but we lack money at the moment. Bryan lost his job, I crashed my car and we remodeled the bathroom. Life aint cheap. I'm making more now than we were combined when we first started out, but we didn't have a mortgage then. As long as we don't go crazy buying shit we don't need we should be OK.
--edit-- We actually had a pretty good time New Year's Eve. Brian brought his new girlfriend over for dinner and I made lots of food and ice cream for dessert. And then I got drunk and laughed at myself as I dropped our wedding album several times. After they left, Bryan and I watched various coverage of Times Square. Carson Daly looked miserable. We had a good time making fun of him.

2013-2014
We had a pretty uneventful year compared to most. The highlights were our trips to Disney and San Francisco and Helen and Darian's wedding. Very excited about my new cousins and becoming an aunt next year! The obvious low point was losing the Buffers :( We still miss her very much. My parents' house isn't the same without a puppy to greet you at the door.
TV? We dumped cable this year :D Dexter finale sucked, but Breaking Bad's was probably one of the best ever. I also watched Orange is the New Black and Downton Abbey.
Last Friday we got to see Cheryl and Yori at Alex and Lenny's. I did catch Bryan's cold, but fortunately I was only really sick Saturday and Sunday when we didn't have plans anyway.
Had a lot of fun at Ellen's last night with the girls. We ate junk food and watched Sex and the City. Good times.
At the moment, I'm at my parents', watching Seinfeld with nothing more exciting planned for the evening. Had spaghetti for dinner.

2014-2015
Let's see this year I found out I was pregnant, announced I was pregnant, had many baby showers, gave birth, hung out with the cutest little guy ever for three months. We also went to Disney and I did much training at work in preparation for changing assignments.
This year I watched an awful lot of Star Trek. Bryan and I watched all of DS9 together, then when Owen was born we watched all of TNG and we're currently going through Voyager. They hold up better than I thought they would. TNG is best overall, DS9 has the best story arc and Voyager is the funniest.
Today was my first day back in the office. I was too preoccupied with pumping to get much done, but I don't have any real work to do anyway and no one was there to give me anything to do. I showed Maryam the training project I made up. I wish I were more creative and could think of something better than a quiz app to make.
Tonight I will probably go to sleep early since I've been up at 2:30am. Not Owen's fault, he slept 7 hours last night and then another 4 1/2. He had us cracking up during his feeding, and then he has no idea why we're laughing, so he just looks at us like we're crazy and then smiles nervously which of course makes us laugh more. Love him.

2015-2016
I spent this past year having the time of my life with my little guy. I look forward to each day wondering what new thing he's going to discover. He loves life and learning about the world. He loves being silly and he loves his family so much. I've had off the last couple weeks and we've had a blast! I really don't want to go back to work.
Last night we left OwenÂ with Bryan's parents while we went to see the new Star Wars. He had a great time and so did we. The movie wasÂ really good. I'm glad we decided to go see it, especially since Owen was fine with his grandparents. He asked about us once and that was all.
In the process of night weaning. Last night went pretty well. He didn't nurse until 1am and I limited him to two minutes. Then he had a twelve course meal at 4am and couldn't get back to sleep :-/ It's 7am now and he's finally resting soundly, but I guess I'm not getting any more sleep this morning. At least I got my workout in.
I guess I usually write about shows I've been watching, ha ha. With our new free DirectTV I've gotten all caught up on the Walking Dead and some of Girl Meets World. Been re-watching Gilmore Girls and it freaks me out a little that I now have more in common with the mom rather than the daughter.
Today, I'm not sure what we're doing, but we always have a good time.",New Years Past,,,,,,
1/16/2016 16:13,1/16/2016 21:13,"Have I written about how Owen will bring you your shoes? When he knows we're going out,&nbsp; or our guests are leaving,&nbsp; he'll go get our shoes. And now he says ""shoes"" too. ""Socks"" are still big too. He tries to say squirrel,&nbsp; but it comes out more like ""caaa."" Cheese and geese are still important in his life. 

He likes to hear the same book over and over until he decides it's time to move onto a new one. Last month it was Babies and Doggies, this month is Mr Brown Can Moo.

We took a break from night weaning because we all got sick. He actually had a double ear infection. All better now and we had his checkup this week too. He's average height now,&nbsp; but he's a bit skinny, probably because he wasn't eating while he was sick. 

We had a lot of fun when I was off those two weeks. Work sucks, only because it takes me away from him, otherwise it's not so bad.

4/15/2016 18:46,4/15/2016 22:46,"Between Owen and how busy I am at work, there's no way to fit in a day in the life during the week, so I bring to you a Saturday in the Life of Lissy: 4/16/16

<!--more-->

2:18am. Owen's up, he wants to nurse. Your goal was to not nurse until 2, so this is reasonable. You wait a few minutes to seeÂ if he'll sleep on his own anyway. No such luck. You feel his diaper, pretty full, but it can wait. You haven't slept too well so far. The pillow stealerÂ struck again. You had to use his boppy as a pillow as he slept on your head. It doesn't take him too long to fall asleep. You unlatch him and count to 60 Mississippi's after he stops squirming. You carefully roll out of bed, but he's on your outer shirt, so you slip out of that. You grab your workout clothes and head downstairs.

Bryan comes up with the baby monitor. He says he hasn't heard him much. Yeah, but he stole your pillow. He apologizes for pillow stealing being genetic.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0558-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0558-1.jpg"" width=""840"" height=""630"" /></a>

You eat your breakfast while watching him thrash around on the monitor. He's going to wake up. He does. Damn. You tell Bryan you're going to change his diaper. He helps you. You go with a regular disposable, that should last until morning. He has a lot of trouble falling back asleep. He seems very uncomfortable. He lets out a couple big burps, that should help. He's finally asleep. One Mississippi, two, damn. You switch sides and nurse some more. He's asleep, you count, you get up.

4:04am.Â You reheat your water, drink as you type this up and put your workout clothes on. You do 20 minutes of intervals on the elliptical while watching season 2 episode 16 of Gilmore Girls on Netflix. You will never get through all of these before the revival. You thoroughlyÂ enjoy how uncomfortable Jess makes Rory. You finish up with a stretch and head upstairs to shower.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0559.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0559.jpg"" width=""225"" height=""300"" /></a>
You brush your teeth while in the shower to save precious time. You need to shave today though, it's been a few days. You will Owen to stay asleep long enough to dry off and put on underwear. Success! You head into your office to do more writing and to maybe even start your Disney vacation planning spreadsheet. He'll wake up the second you open Excel. Oh, oh, there he goes, he's stirring. No, no... Any minute now. Spreadsheet is open. Wow, he's still asleep. Internet isn't working, you need to reboot. Planning is the best part of the vacation :) You hope it isn't interrupted by work later. Prod install today and you're one of three people that knows which way is up on this project. You have to potty, he'll wake up for sure while you're in the bathroom. No? Yay. He did move though. Wouldn't be so bad to get s little more sleep, but you appreciate the alone time too.

The schedule is hard this year, so many variables. The Easy WDWÂ crowd calendar isn't up for November, you don't know the schedule for the new Rivers of Light, you don't know what Owen's sleep will be like, plus, oh yes, your entire extended family that's coming too. You enjoy the challenge :) Wow, he's still sleeping. Well, you probably won't get to sleep anymore, but you need extra time today for your Day in the Life anyway. You upload your sheet to get your cousin's opinion. And now he's awake. You go in to nurse him. Hmm, you should make those Disney lunches after his nap instead of before. He falls asleep quickly. Good, you get to snooze too.

7:00am. You wake up, he wakes up about 15 minutes later. All he wants to do is nurse and snuggle. He pats your chest ""bo bo."" You convince him to get up. You let him brush his teeth and play with your phone ""hewo!"" while you go to the bathroom and get dressed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0560-1.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0560-1.jpg"" width=""748"" height=""561"" /></a>
You swap his disposable for a clothÂ diaper and sing the New Diaper Song (which, as Bryan pointed out is actually a jngle.. the ""pug it in""Â jingle: ""tuck it in, tuck it in""). He talks as his yellow duplo as if it were a phone as he makes his way downstairs. YouÂ make him a smoothie for breakfast and reheat a slice of pizza Bryan made for dinner last night for yourself. Â He doesn't want out of his high chair, he tries to buckle himself back in.

Poop check. No poop. Walk time? ""Walk!"" He doesn't want to wear his hood. You explain is cold, he has to wear the hood or hat. He lets you put the hat on. ""Hat!"" You see many Doggies on your stroll ""daw!"" Owen says ""cat!"" But you only see a bunny statue. He's very excited about the lawn guys. ""Tguck, see! Tguck, see!""

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_082949.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full"" title=""20160416_082949.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_082949.jpg"" alt=""image"" /></a>

Back home he plays with his toy cell and you hope he poops. Back upstairs to change his clothes. No poo!Â He points to the catalog on the floor ""baby! "" No, that's a lady. He points to her shoes: ""shoes!"" He picks up his foot: ""feet! ""

9:10am.Â You grab him and head out the door. You take the wrong road. You think you're going to Wegmans? Work? It's OK, you can get to 287 from here, except you don't get off where you're supposed to and end up back on 9.The signÂ said south, you want north! You've only lived here 9 years. You exit and turn around and now you're on the right track. You get there on time and actually get the last parking spot.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_093343.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" title=""20160416_093343.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_093343.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""385"" height=""684"" /></a>

Owen has a good time running around. He likes bouncing on the air log and putting the soft wedges through the holes. He enjoysÂ the ""bubbles!"" He bangs on the air log before it's time for the song and refuses to touch it during, of course. At the end of class he goes up and down, side to side and twists with Gymbo. He tries to walk out withÂ the purple wedge. He's ready to go. There's someone waiting for your spot as you strap him in the car. Getting out of there is a little crazy. The whole block is having a yard sale, plus a police officer pulled someone over and completely blocked traffic. A lot of cars on 287 too. Must be the nice weather.

You arrive home and throw some butternut squash mac an cheese in the microwave for Owen. He already made his way upstairs and you find him jumping on his chair. You go wake up Bryan and Owen jumps on the bed and knocks the humidifier on the floor: ""uh oh!"" He plays with it a while before you grab him and drag him downstairs.

You serve Owen some of the mac and cheese ""cheese!"" and he eats it by the handful.Â Bryan asks if he had a fun time at Gymboree. You tell him how he went up and down with Gumbo and Owen says ""up 'n down"" and puts his arms up and down. Something new every day. He eats the Mac and cheese and feeds some to his toy horse. He pets the horse ""nice!"" You chase him around with the food as he plays and he pauses to take bites.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_104734.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" title=""20160416_104734.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_104734.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""322"" height=""573"" /></a>

11:05am.Â Time to get ready for his nap. You take him upstairs and change his diaper while you nurse him since he's angry about the diaper change. You sing the new diaper song. No poop! You nurse him while he plays with your hair. Bryan takes him in for his nap and you wave bye and blow a kiss.

You heat up your second slice of pizza and type up some more of this while you wait. Step check, 7,053. Oh, you actually have some time for Facebook? Bryan comes down and gives you a hug. You eat your pizza and munch on some trail mix too. You reply to a post in Badass Breastfeeders. Back upstairs for more Disney plannin'!

You try on the shoes you bought for Julia's wedding again. They fit well and they're comfortable, but you feet slide a bit making them hard to walk in. You decide you can probably buy an insert. Unlikely you'll find another pair of pretty, comfy shoes, though these were expensive.

Ugh, you need a tissue. You're still congested from the cold you had earlier in the week. You use a shirt from your laundry. To the DIS boards! Aww, no Festival of the Masters this year? :( You'll keep the DTD day anyway.

Your mom texts to call, you do. She wants to know what weekends you have plans so they can go to the Poconos before Julia's bachelorette party you're hosting there. You decide the weekend before since you're going to her birthday party that Sunday. You need to buy mother's day gifts...

You go to amazon to look at Disney board books for Owen and remember you need to order diapers, so you subscribe and save those too. You put $18 worth of books in your cart.

Owen's still napping, so you head to the basement to get in some more steps and watch Gilmore Girls before he wakes up. Oh soppy cups, right, you need to wash those. Maybe you'll start making your breakfast too. So productive. You'll add the banana later. Now you go to the basement for Gilmore Girls. And another Bryan hug :)

Owen still sleeping, you switch gears and watch some Big Bang Theory too. He's still sleeping, you go up to check on him and then... More Disney planning?

You hear him coughing so you go in and check on him again. He's up! You nurse him on the bed while Bryan showers. You bring him downstairs and heat up the rest of his mac and cheese. He's pooping! You let him eat a few bites of food and bring him up to change his diaper. You put him in a disposable since you're going out to Grammy and Papi's. You go flush his poop and his crying and crying back in the nursery, so you nurse him a little before going down again. Bryan says he probably wants to go downstairs. You were about to.

2:50pm. You let him have a little more food and you pack the rest to go. You feed him some in the car. Bryan wants to know if you want to go the new route, you say you're curious. It definitely takes longer to go through new Brunswick, but now you know how to get to Target. Bryan rants about bad drivers and bad street signs.

You arrive at Grammy and Papi's and Owen immediately starts playing with his popper. He sits in all the chairs. Grammy says we're ordering wraps. You'll get the turkey avocado panini, Owen likes that one too.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_153735.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" title=""20160416_153735.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_153735.jpg"" alt=""image"" width=""525"" height=""933"" /></a>

He runs in the other room, sits on the chair for a while and then plays with the box. He doesn't want to try the strawberries. ""No.""

He sees your carrier and wants to go out. Bryan put his shoes on. ""Shoes! "" You play outside for a bit. He collects a couple rocks and then wants to come back in. He plays with the <a href=""https://youtu.be/qF6GFEy5PtI"">train whistle</a> while Grammy and Papi go and get food.

You buckle him into his high chair when they get back and he eats a good chunk of your turkey, but doesn't touch the avocado. You really enjoy your panini. And the potato wedges, yummm.

He wants out, so you take him out and he runs around in circles. You nurse him a little. His leg gets stuck when he tries to get down. He cries, so you nurse him a couple more minutes. Papi goes up to nap. Owen makes a farting noise on your face he's very proud of. He makes more farting noises on the chair. Grammy shows you pictures from Bryan's cousin's wedding. ""Ooooooh!"" He turns the TV on. He's never seen anyone do it. He sees a cat on the TV ""cat!""

Lynn asks if you want ice cream. ...maybe. Bryan doesn't want any, he ate too much. Sea salt caramel Gelato, yum. Papi comes back down. Grammy was taking about Owen hiding his tooth brushes and he went and found one. He's intent on breaking the turtle lamp, Grammy and Papi call him over.

He finds your shoes and feet. Grammy goes outside with Owen. You take some of the Gelato, mmmmm. Ooh, 10,000 steps! Papi has baseball on. Grammy gives Owen some water in a ninja turtle cup. You offer him more mac and cheese, he puts the lid back on. You can take a hint. He brings Papi the animal sound book to read, but forgets about it when he gets distracted by the water. You look up directions to the turtle back zoo since you might go there tomorrow. Owen is walking around on his knees and now dragging his butt like a dog. He puts his cup in the box.

He tries to get the phone in the kitchen and other things he shouldn't play with. He climbs on the couch to get the light switch. Papi reads him the animal sounds book.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_175619.jpg""><img class=""alignnone size-full"" title=""20160416_175619.jpg"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/20160416_175619.jpg"" alt=""image"" /></a>

He pets Papi and plays with the sounds in the book. You nurse him a little. To see if he's hungry you offer a puree or mac and cheese, he picks both. He gets some puree on the carpet. Some more running around and then time to go. He sees his ball outside ""ball! ""Tries to collect more rocks and says ""bye bye"" to Grammy and Papi. You feed Owen a little more in the car.

7:00pm. You arrive back home. Bryan offers Owen more food while you add the banana to your breakfast. You all go upstairs and get ready for bed. Bryan changes Owen's diaper and puts his PJs on while you get yourself ready. You hear him brush his teeth ""ch ch ch ch."" he reads him the Birthday Monsters book and you read Oh My, Oh My, Oh Dinosaurs while you nurse him. Daddy says good night and Owen nurses some more. Owen wants to read Goodnight Goon before going to bed.

<a href=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0571.jpg""><img class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://silvercpu.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/img_0571.jpg"" width=""777"" height=""583"" /></a>Â Â <span id=""img_container_6F86BF0A-CCA2-4587-B860-E571F64EDE07"" class=""img_container"" data-failed=""Tap to try again!""></span>
Then you head to the bedroom. Owen of course immediately starts jumping on the bed. You grab him and sit him on your lap and sing to him and nurse him and nurse him and nurse him...

8:00pm. Still nursing him. He's squirming, it hurts. You yell at him to stop. He cries, you feel bad. Nurse, nurse. You start nodding off, he wants to switch sides. You fall asleep, he wants to switch sides. 9:30 you wake up and he's still thrashing around. It's not a good night. He eventually falls asleep.

1:08am. He's up and really wants to nurse. Ugh, not until 2. He freaks outs and is screaming. You cover your ears to prevent permanent hearing damage. You feel awful. Stay strong Lissy. A half hour later he finally settles down and tries to sleep. You let him climb all over your head to find a comfortable position. You can tell he's really trying, but another half hour later, he's still awake and getting frustrated. It's after 2, you decide it's time to change his diaper and nurse. Thus ends the day. (But if you were wondering, the kid doesn't sleep until 4:30)",A Day in the Life of Lissy 4/16/16,,,,,,

He's pretty content during the day though. Saying new things all the time.

We saw Carolyn, Tom and Connor on Saturday. Owen had a blast playing with Connor's toys, chasing the cat around saying ""gat"" and showing Connor how to jump on furniture.

Yesterday cousin Ronnie came over with my parents for a visit. Owen was showing off his toys and dancing skills. I ate way too much junk and now I have a food hangover.

I was super productive this weekend though. I did our taxes, clean the floor and made <a href=""http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/"">Chocolate Covered Katie</a>'s thin mints from her cookbook.
